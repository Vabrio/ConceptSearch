<p>
Abu'l Qásim Faizí was born in the city of Qúm, Irán, 1909 [sic — other sources give 1906. -J.W.]. This town is famous for its theological institutions, the best known being the "Faizí School of Theology" where thousands study and live expecting to be great religious leaders in Iran. His maternal uncle was the head of this institution and well known throughout Persia and Iraq as one of the few leaders of the Shi'ih sect of Islám.
<p>
At the age of eight or nine he left his birthplace for Tihrán. As he went to Tarbíyat School (a Bahá'í School) for his elernentary education. He went to the classes on the Bahá'í Faith as well, and gradually became an adherent of the Faith.
<p>
When he was 19 years old, he went to the American University of Beirut. Because of its closeness to Haifa, Mr. Faizí had the honor of meeting Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, several times. During these visits he heard from the Guardian that youths' ideal in life should be the consecration of their lives for the service of the Bahá'í Cause; that is to say, to spread the healing message of Bahá'u'lláh, God's latest Messenger - the Message of Love, Justice, the Oneness of Mankind. Mr. Faizí determined to follow this guidance and after graduation from the University, with a degree in English Literature and Education, he went to Persia. Here he spent five years in a village educating 600 Bahá'í children who had no means of education. He went to Qazvín where more than 30 youth were trained in one year to be scattered throughout the world as Bahá'í pioneers and teachers. Following this, he spent one year in Baghdád where he helped the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of Iraq and the pioneers. Fifteen years were spent in Arabia where he lived as a pioneer himself.
<p>
In 1957 he was designated by the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith a "Hand of the Cause of God"-- an appointment of honor and responsibility. Since the passing of the Head of the Faith, Mr. Faizí has lived in Haifa, as one of the "Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land."
