               PILGRIMAGE TO HAIFA
                       by
                WILLIAM B SEARS
                     [1954]

  Each pilgrim makes two pilgrimages in one, the pilgrimage
of the head and the pilgrimage of the heart.
  The first it the pilgrlmage of the mind; notes taken of
special information, new developments of the Faith whole
you are present, instructions from the Guardian to be applied
to one's community or one's self. "This is the pilgrimage of
what the Guardian said".

  The second is the pilgrimage of the emotions: the sea that
surges inside the pilgrim room the moment he catches hit
first glimpse of that glistening, golden dome. This is the
warm flooding tide that soon will fill every empty inlet
along the coastline of his spirit. This is the pilgrimage
of joys, ectasies, [sic.] sorrows, shames repentances and
reformations that storm through his being. It is the first
meeting with the Guardian, the first walk along the [...]
path that leads to the Shrine of the Bab, the moment that
holy door is swung inward for the first time and enter the
presence of the gentle, lovable Bab, the very air of whose
Shrine throbs with the blood of the martyrs.  This is the
pilgimage of reunion with the welcoming arms of the wonderful
Master. It is above all, the awe-stricken moment when the
impure heart dares to present itself before that sanctified
spot where the supreme Manifestation it enshrined. This is
the pilgrimage of Bahji, Masraih, [sic.] Ridvan, the house at
Akka, the prison-cell, the sufferings, the triumphs that are
relived again through the eyes of each pilgrim who looks
upon this land so much beloved.
  It is of this second pilgrimage that I wish to speak here,
of one all too short part of it. The followlng is my
recollection of that first and that last meeting with our
Guardian.

  These, of course, are pilgrims notes. I have tried to be
as accurate as possible in recording my impressions, but they
are only the impressions of one pilgrim.  If written by
another pilgrim during the same days, they might present
an entirely different aspect. Shoghi Effendi is like the
rays of the sunlight. He exposes whatever subjects matter
is latent on the inner film of each pilgrim. The same sun in
the same field on the same day will warm and raise up many
different flowers.  The following are my personal recollections
of what he was like, some of the things he said, and some of
the things I was told he said, nothing more.
  I arrived the morning of April l, 1954. In addition to my
44 pounds of airline luggage, I had in pockets, two tins of
potatoes, a bottle of catsup, a small tin of coffee a
large bottle of coffee, fifty Greek pamphlets, seven notebooks,
four bottles of toilet articles, and an eight pound automatic
electric hot Nader heater.
  I spent hue day doing things which are written elsewhere.
Now l can not remember them, I recall only the deep longing
in my heart to see the Guardian.  I wanted to take a long
pole and push the sun down into the Mediterranean so that
evenig would hasten.
  My feelings were of mingled fear and courage: Fear to stand
beofre him look unto those eyes that mutt see all the stains
that darken the inside of a person; courage that if only I
could look upon him, tell him of my love and beg forgiveness
in my heart, nothing else would really matter.
  Darkness stole away our lovely view of the Bab's Shrine from
the Pilgrim House window.  By then, I had stiffened my liquid
knees for the moment of going through the dining room door into
his presence.  My business life had been filled for years with
"first nights" but never had there been one such as this. Never
had I hoped that an audience might find some merit in me, and I
knew that approval could not be won this time by "performing"
only by not performing.  This was a different world, not shadow
but reality.

+P2

I had tried to prepare myself to meet him by praying with such
fervor as I never used before in all by Baha'i life, I would
have been prepared to meet him now without it. A number of other
things came to my mind all of which led me to want to pack my
bag and flee to a pioneer post.
  Then word came that the Guardian was still at Bahji and would
stay the night there and not be with us at dinner. I felt as
though I would weep before everyone.  However I didn't. It was
just as well that I did not.  In the days to come I would learn
what it was to shed tears, both of joy and of repentance.
  Haifa a without the  Guardian is like an eye without its
sight.  Dr. Lotf\ullah Hakim's whimsical comment it a virtual
truth, "It is the holy land ln his presence and the 'helliland'
in his absence."
  When we were told that Shoghi Effendi was making plans to it
illuminate the inner Shrine of Baha'u'llah at Bahji, our emptiness
was soon forgotten.  Ruhiyyih Khannum was so kind and loving.
She knew the inner disappointment that each pilgrim tried not
to show. Millle Collins, Leroy Ioas, Mason Remey, everyone
bestowed upon us a special love that first night.
  Dawn prayers at the Shrines, weed-puIling in the gardens,
laughter at lunch recording first ipressions, transferring books
for a new library, tea, bathe, shave, dress--evening!
  Some of us were upstairs in the north sitting room when there
was a scurrying about, the sound of rapid footsteps, a light tap
on the door and the words, "He is here!"  Magic words. The quiet
house comes to life. Its like opening a faucet.  All flows
immediately toward the Guardian. No precious second of his
presence must by lost. Everyone hurries to the head of the stairs,
merging into a single-file line as they descend. At the foot of
the stairs, the Hands and the others step aside to permit the
pilgrims to enter first.
  We walked quickly along the lower hallway toward the dining-room,
still exchanging places for the proper order. I tried to peek
around the back of the pilgrim in front of me for my first glimpse
of the Guardian. Her back prevented it.
  Then I was in the room. l heard his voice for the first time as
he greeted her and shook handy with her. "Good evening", he said.
  She replied, "Good evening, Shoghi Effendi".
  She stepped aside, and I was revealed to him in all my
unworthiness.
  There was no place to hide.
  Dr. Giachery had told me in Rome that each time he approached that
door he got cold shivers down his spine, and that he felt like a
little boy caught with the jam on his face. He told me this, but
he didn't tell me that it was such a very cold shiver and that there
was so very much jam.
  Our eyes met. "Good evening," he said, and I replied.
  What I said I can't remember because I saw him coming toward me.
He held out his arms and embraced me.
  We have been expecting you for a long time", he said, as he
kissed me on the right cheek and then the left, then the right.
I clung to him ever so tightly. My predominate feeling was, "I
have come home". My chest hurt it felt so big. My throat was
stopped up. My eyes tried to shed tears that were pouring from
every part of my being, but the task was too great for them.
They stored up and blinded me.
  "We have heard much about you", he said. I held him tightly hoping
I need never let go. "Now we are happy that you are with us at last."
l turned back to the table to find my seat. It was directly opposite him,
so close I could have reached over and touched his hand. When my vision
cleared, I could see that every other eye way also misty. When the next
pilgrim arrived, I would know why.  Every Baha'i heart is knitted
to the other [...?] and shares this ecstasy when the Guardian greets
new pilgrims for the first time.  When I saw the next pilgrims come,
I, too, wept with joy for them. I thought Or the words of the
obligatory prayer, "burn away the veils that have shut me out from
Thy Beauty and (be) a light that will lead unto the ocean of Thy
Presence."

  My fears had all vanished now, and I felt only a transcendent happiness.

of your own Jill clothe it in flesh. If you have seen him, Lou will under-
stand this.

the ~uardlan, as I remember him, is short in stature, Lois hair 19 dark,
graying on the sides. Fe ls of medium to dark complexion. Fe has dark eyes
that seem to become a shade lighter when they are most animated, as though
they burned with some inner fore. ~lis features are regular. Fe ls smooth
shaven e~ccept for a dark moustache. There 1~ an energetic quality about his
person, oven at rest. Fe ls very sturdy. I nudge this by the firmness I
felt when He embraced me. Fe has small, slender hands which are shapely
and expressive. All of his gestures are extremely graceful. Fe yore a rust
colored topcoat over his inner clothes all during the tlm~ I was there.
his tie was al~ay~ brown. Fe wears a slender gold ~aha'i ring on the second
finger of I right hand. Fe wears a black fez with a block button in the
center Or the top. Almost every evening he brought some Ned cable, map,
dra~lng, or document with him to the table. frequently he dl-qcusses the work

No one speaks English as ;:hoghl Effendl speaks it. r~ere may be a moment
hesitation as he searches for a word, but each tl~e he brings forth a jewel
that inspires a quiver Or delight.

etera Ned our pace; yet, the more sublime our attitude and the less panicky
our Ida methods. The Guardia n moves a cross the vast spaces to be con-
quered by the faith as a cyclone moves. Its speed 19 astounding, yet at the

heart Or the cyclone all is at peace as lt moves. The farther one ls from
thus tranquil center, the more violent the reaction. If we have withdrawn
from the center and are on the outer fringes, we are torn to bits and des-
troyed. we must move with thy power or be shattered by the impact.

This it west it ls like to be in the presence of the guardian. Fe 1~ the
power of electriciyt that can heat, warm, comfort, and light our liveY~ Bud
lf we misuse it we are destroyed. The breeze that cools you when you are
fe~erlsh, the wind that sails your craft speeding on lots Kay, the gentle
breath that shakes the ripened fruit and drops them at you feet ls the gale,
Thor hurricane that rushed in to crush what has become a vacuum.

You can feel the heat of his pace, you are shaken by the draft of his
passing, you can see the light of his spirit, Fe is a giant comet that
blazes across the sky, drawing into his orbit all the bit.~ of matter that
can feed the flame of his fire.. All that can burn with this same fire are
drawn in to increase thy brightness. Those who are not attracted by thus
by this blazing ball of fore thunder past. They may try, too late, to enter
rut the moment for the junction ls passed. ~l~he finery tail of the comet Iwo
by them and Thea are left ln darkness.

~l~his i8 the guardian. l have emphasisNed this feeling of action most of
all because it predominates the others. Action-then results. Not big pro-
tects planned, but small protects completed. Fe does not interest himself in
what you are going to do, but in what you have done.

Even more important than thus urgency for action, I the need for obedience.
~l~he very breath of life ~lthln the faith, you feel, is obedience. ~aha'u~l~ah
a id of ~bdu~ a ha, "Who obeys elm, obeys Godon The Easter had said of

- ~hoghi ~ffenii in his Will and Testament ~hl obeys him, obeys Godill You
Knox now that there can be no partial obedience to God. If there is, you have
only partial understanding of the ~alth, and you get only partial results.
You have investigated and made your choice; exercised your independence in
coming to the pa it. Now is the time for obedience. In the words of the
prayer, "Instant, e:~act, and complete obedience. n We must be like the great
cypress trees standing outside the shrine of ~aha~utllah. They bow and bend
low before the brie.~s of God from whichever direction it may blow.

The guardian said that the friends feel that it is difficult to leave
their homes and pioneer, Eden to move to thy goals in.~lde Thea,o~m countries.
They do not see that he is not asking them to sacrifice. Fe is protecting
them from themselves. Fe is protecting them not only from the calamity
that is rushing toward them outwardly, but he ls protecting them from the
calamity that is rushing toward them inwardly.

"American, he Sara, nix no longer even actively quarreling. ~l~hey are pass-
ively stagnantill This is why, hw said, that he askew them to diaper.Qe; 80

~4hing because the part he Han left with us is too much for us to carry.
We must share it with each other or burst. h'ye~ ~lcwly~ umrilllngly, turn
from the door of his departure, We look at each other as though Fe remember
for the first time who we are. Deep sighs are heard on every sloe Al we
breathe out the last of that air of his presence. These sight are more
eloquent than words. They say, nI9n~t he wonderful I Oh if only Fe could

You seat yourselves at the table or you go up to the slotting room where you
can repeat to each other all that he bald.

These sweet sighs of t~ndern~s~ and love stay ~lth you long unto the
~air~ nights. You relive each moment with the guardian over and over again.
Wide eye-~ ln the dark night. You do not wish to close them or waste these
precious, intoxicating hours in sleep.

It ls now the last night of your pilgrimage. Your cup is slowing over..
There 1~ no .rore room. This wonderful Water of Life ls running down the
tides. You are eager to rush off to your pout before Sony is lost or wasted.
your eyes hungrily drink in thi-~ last glimpse of your beloved ~ardian.

finally the moment of heartache comes. The guardian pushes his ringed-
napkln forward for thy last time. Jim eyes look across the table and into
yours. He understands. You fell that you a re an arrow pulled back to the

presence. Jagger as you are to try your new-found wings, you regret leaving

~~he next.

He rose. We followed. Fe came to me. Our beloved guardian took both of
hands in his, warm love streamed from hl~ touch unto my very belong. The sign
of God on earth looked into my eyes; love, kindness, forgiveness surrounded
me. l, who had given nothing, had received everything, I, who had neglected

and are sent forth to work on ~odts vineyard; the second ye come with banners
flying, Luke ~oldlers, it gladness and triumph to receive your reward.~

Our beloved ~uardlan told us, I he pilgrimage it riven to you that you may

bestow. without this there Han been no pilgrimage. lt Jill dissolve into
nothing.

The pilgrims comes ~-o the land of his beloved, to the heart of the pause,
laden with the impurities of the world. were, he is refreshed and restored,
i so that he may Bø back into the vineyard to bring the love-creating, llfe-
restoring word of God into all parts of the earth.

In this last moment, you learn the supreme lesson; it does not matter what
you havedone~ who you may be, what your powers, talents~ and background in
the wraith may have been up u4~il now. nothing matters except your complete
consecration to ~a~a~u~llah from this moment on. All else it secon~ry.
