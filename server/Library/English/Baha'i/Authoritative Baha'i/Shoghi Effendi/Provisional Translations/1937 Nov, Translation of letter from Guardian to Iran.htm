<p> O ye assisters of God's Cause! The Centre of Covenant 
breaking, the Pivot of dissension after a period of forty 
years during which he had lain in a corner and in his 
nether state of humiliation was witnessing the lights of 
divine confirmation descending [on the Cause] in forty 
territories, eventually with an empty hand with a heart 
full of sighs returned to his abode disappointed, in 
perdition, in a sorry state. The Great Branch was 
transformed to the Great Firewood. <br>
<font color=maroon> O ye helpers of the Cause of God! The Centre of Covenant Breaking, the very Pivot of Dissension [Muhammad 'Ali] after a period of forty years -- during which he had been forced to witness, in an abject state of humiliation, the lights of divine confirmation descending successively upon the Cause across forty territories -- eventually with an empty hand and a heart full of sighs returned to his nether abode. Disappointed, abased, a pathetic state indeed -- the 'Greater Branch' was reduced to the 'Greater Firewood.'</font>

<p> One can see him in the nethermost
region The rod of divine chastisement and wrath has got hold of him as
wielded by the All-subduing Avenger. This is what Our Master had warned
openly and privily and exalted is indeed his promise uttered by truth
bearing holy and wondrous utterances. His non-existent entity which as
the Ancient Beauty, glorified be His Greatest Name had said, " If but a
moment he turns away he shall be utterly non existent," in outward reality
has now become non-being. It has now gone under the depth of the earth.<br>
<font color=maroon> One can find him only in the nethermost region. The rod of Divine chastisement and wrath -- wielded by the All-subduing Avenger -- hath seized hold of him. This is that of which our Master hath warned both openly and privily. Exalted indeed is His promise revealed in truth-bearing, holy and wondrous utterances. Even in outward form his abased existence has become non-existence. As the Ancient Beauty, glorified be His Greatest Name had said, <i>"Should he for a moment pass out from under the shadow of the Cause, he surely shall be brought to naught."</i> Indeed, he has returned (?) to depths of the earth. </font>


<p>Where is he now and his conspiratorial adjutants and his falsifying ambassadors and his lying trustees, and his tremulous followers who were wont to travel in the lands many a year and who sought to extinguish the light of God in vain with the breathings of their mouth and who sought to attack the sanctity of God's covenant with their ingrained hatreds and malice. How evil what they thought! How atrocious what they perpetrated! Their efforts were brought to nought. Their company was dispersed. Their aspirations met with utter despondency. Their foundations are destroyed. They have no one to aid them. God's decree came upon them and made them join the lost ones. Even their mention will become non-existent their traces will vanish. Ye shall hear no voice no whisper about them. God will make them utterly forgotten. O ye steadfast lovers of the Ancient Beauty Ponder awhile. Reflect deeply in the evidences of divine ascendancy and the penetrating power of His might, which is most extraordinary and amazing. Think in a most profound way on the events and the vicissitudes of this Great Cause. Recall the past events and stages. What great difficulties came to pass since its inception from the horizon of that land full of turmoil and tribulation! What violent assaults what forceful attacks were perpetrated against its beauteous Body by friend and foe! 

<p> From the beginning of the Divine Theophany in the year sixty [1260 AH 1844 AD] until our day this incomparable Plant which the Hand of Divine Power has planted in the garden of this World has been encompassed by such troubles has been beaten upon by such storms has been assaulted by such whirlwinds the like of which is unheard of and unrecorded in any history whatever. The wicked divines to start with unfurled the banner of the most great animosity and misled the unfair and ignorant nation and motivated the masses to perform infinite assaults and aggressions against the Faith of God. 

<p> From another corner the pillars of the oppressive Qajar government unleashed the hand of pillage against it and inflicted upon the sacred realities and institutions of the Wronged One great injuries. That government suspended the sinless and holy Body of Its Herald in the air and with the bullets of hatred and rancour lacerated His luminous breast and caused twenty thousand of His followers to drink the chalice of martyrdom. 

<p> From another part the Ottoman sultan the pivot of the Caliphate joined forces with the earlier most inveterate enemy and imprisoned the Divine Lawgiver. They banished Him from land to land until eventually He was exiled to the "most desolate city". For forty years they made Him [Baha'u'llah] drink the poison of every tribulation. In Iraq in Constantinople, in the land of Mystery Adrianople in the Most Great Prison such wrong and oppression was permitted against Him that the like of it has not been seen by the eye of creation and the ear of all nations. The heads of government and the masses of the people aided each other and for ninety years in its homeland and neighbouring lands and in this Holy Land with all their power girded their loins to extinguish this light and to disperse this assemblage and to destroy this divine Foundation and to belittle and cast aspersion on this Sacred Name. They never rested until the lightning of Wrath took them and the winds of perdition came upon them and they fell and were hurled from the heights of glory and power to the nether reaches of humiliation and degradation. The hands of the divines in the words of 'Abdul-Baha [the Centre of the Covenant of the Self-Subsisting and Living God] lost their reach and their degrading became apparent. in His own words: "Their honour will be transmuted to the great dishonour. this outward power and pomp will be transformed to the greatest defeat. Palaces will change to Prisons. Their heights of heaven will end as the bottom of the well. Their laughter and hilarity will not abide nay the voice of tears and lamentations will be upraised." The Qajar dynasty was uprooted. Its chain of succession was broken. Its star set forever. The blood spilling monarch [Nasirud-Din Shah] who suspended the Most pure the Most sinless Temple of Divine Meekness[the Bab] and who directed bullets of hatred against His Holy Chest was hurled to the nethermost abyss and his family and grandchildren are scattered all over the world. The evil Abdul-Hamid who afflicted the Wronged One and His Glorious Branch in the Greatest Prison with all manner of troubles he himself was ensnared in turmoil and was dethroned, jailed and extinguished. In a little while the foundations of the Ottoman Empire were shaken and the Caliphate terminated. The Sultanate became a Republic. ancient glory changed into palpable dishonour. Our God the AllGlorious Lord spoke in truth. May His utterance remain exalted, said He " O concourse of divines ! Because of you the people were abased, and the banner of Islam was hauled down, and its mighty throne subverted." O ye loved ones of His Holiness 'Abdu'l-Baha! The collapse of the great Caliphate and the destruction of the foundations of the Sultanate and the abrogation of Islamic ordinances and repeal of Shari'at courts in Constantinople and the separation of state from religion in Turkey and the humiliation of the divines of the Faith of the Prophet the Chief of the Apostles of God [upon Himself be a myriad salutation and praise!] and all that will come to pass in the future in the neighbouring lands upon the wicked divines whether pertaining to Shi'ih or Sunni all of the above is as a direct spiritual consequences of that conspicuous injustice perpetrated by those twin perfidious monarchs the supporters of the divines in those twin countries. In the Surih revealed for Amin these exalted words have descended [from the Heaven of Revelation]: O concourse of Islam Verily Muhammad the Apostle of God wept sore by reason of your wrong doings for ye followed your vain desires and turned away from sure guidance Ere long ye will see the consequences of your deeds. For my Lord is as a Guardian on a watchtower.[Q: 89:14]ö O Concourse of Baha! Consider and reflect The enemies of the Cause of Jesus Christ [May my spirit be a sacrifice to the wrongs He suffered] who were the primary instigators and the real cause of the martyrdom of that Sinless Soul although they acted against Christ that Peerless Beauty only a limited number of days and encircled and captured Him yet those enemies were afflicted with what a humiliation! The Roman Emperor embarked on the attack against the enemy and brought to dust the glorious House of Worship of that Faith and the exalted Temple. Jerusalem was utterly destroyed and the poor nation was to endure a scattering throughout the earth. It is well nigh two thousand years that the Israelites as a consequence of this enormous injustice have been suffering with great sufferings and have been spread throughout but now in this all glorious century this gracious Dispensation the scroll of their humiliation is at an end and their requital is over and as a result of the overshadowing beneficence of the Divine Teachings the ancient glories will be restored unto them. Again ponder with discernment although the enemies of Christ were engaged only a mere few years in opposition and antagonism yet they were afflicted with such a great degradation for twenty centuries Howbeit in this Supreme Theophany and Most excellent religious cycle which is the glory of all past ages and centuries what will be visited upon enemies who for seventy years have inflicted such unheard of sufferings upon the Blessed Beauty His Herald and His Most Great Most Honoured Branch. What retribution will befall them in the realm of the visible! My pen truly trembles at its attempt to even refer to what shall befall the oppressors! My heart truly cries over them over their degradations, over their sufferings and all that will transpire in this transcendent this luminous this Great Dispensation."

<p>	Let me resume my theme [i.e. the fall of Muhammad 'Ali etc] It is true the divines the rulers the kings each according to their part attacked the Faith of the Wronged One of the World from all sides. They endeavoured greatly to shed the blood of the meek ones of the earth, their killing, the banishment and exile of the Founders of this clearly Divine Cause. But it should be evident that these assaults and attacks although ferocious and violent in their own right. Yet what transpired in the interior of the Community of the followers of the One God from deeds of the claimers of its adherence and affection rather from the persons related to the Holy Tree and those who branched from the Sacred Plant was many times and many categories greater and more virulent compared to those assaults emanating from outside the Faith from the external foes and those who held the reins of power. A person related to the Divine Tree apparently honoured with being a brother of the Supreme Manifestation of God [Mirza Yahya] whose mention was recorded in many a communication of the Pen of the Point of the Bayan [May the spirit of all being be a sacrifice unto His true lovers!], he who was a Mirror of the Babi Dispensation, he who was to obtain a faint glimmer of the Sinaic Splendour. Whose care was entrusted in the Bab's writing to the Ancient Beauty Baha'u'llah [May the spirits of all those near unto God be a sacrifice to His Sovereignty!] and who for a certain number of years was at the behest of the LifeGiver of the world a person for the Babis to turn to and to refer to such a person denied and waxed proud. He arose to oppose. He did such wrongs and inflicted such cruelty that no pen is able to depict them no paper can bear their narration! He perpetrated such an assault He cause the drinking of such a poison that no eye has witnessed no ear has heard. In Adrianople he caused such a great convulsion and tumult and was able to shake the faith of a number and cause them to wander lost. He was able to cheer up the inveterate enemies and was able to give hope to the sect of Karim Khan. The Concourse on High shed tears of blood from his wrongdoing and the party of the faithful and steadfast ones sighed the sigh of lamenting. The earthquakes of the day of Wrath predicted in the Tablet of Nasir came to be fulfilled. And the tremours of the Afflictive Period made their effect felt. The wasting blasts blew and the Sun of the Heaven of Truth for a while was eclipsed by the eclipse of his hatred. The Star of the Heaven of Divinity was momentarily veiled by the clouds of his rancour. He caused Baha'u'llah to drink such a poison of suffering that His Tongue of Divine Grandeur spoke such a heart rending utterance in a Tablet of His: ô I wish I had been non-existent and My Mother hadn't borne Me I swear by God! If any one were to become cognisant of what befell He would assuredly seek to dwell in the wilderness and would flee from anyone seeking his company Furthermore He would not eat anything until at last he would give his life as a ransom in the love of this incandescent and Luminous Beauty! All that has appeared externally is not anything in my sight that I should mention it. Rather what has befallen Me inside This is that which the Concourse of heavens cannot bear. The entire existence cannot bear it either I swear I cannot mention a letter of it. For if I mention a letter thereof all heavens and earth will be cloven asunder! Also in the Tablet of the Dove these two verses disclose the sufferings and tragedies My tears when flowing are indeed the real Flood of Noah The burning of My heart is indeed what reminds one of the Abraham Fire Jacob suffered with the least of My sorrows and all that befell Job is part of My sufferings! In a little while another assault was launched by a claimer of belief and one related to the Beauty of the Merciful God on to the temple of the Cause of the All Beneficent Lord The tornado of tests blew fiercely again. And the dustclouds of Covenant Breaking were upraised. The Most Great Convulsion in the Prison of the Quickener of the World after the Setting of the Sun of Pre-existence came to pass. A son amongst the sons of Baha'u'llah the Ancient Beauty who for many a year had drunk the milk of divine providence from the breast of loving kindness who had grown up in the cradle of Divine Overseeing who had been described and known as the Ghusn-i-Akbar [i.e. Muhammad 'Ali] Further he had been explicitly refereed to in the Book of the Covenant and in the Scroll of Divine Testament. Baha'u'llah had referred to him with these honorific and special words: "We have chosen the Akbar [the Greater] after the A'zam [the Most Great] Such a person broke the Divine Covenant. The fire of his envy burned with an amazing conflagration. He got hold of the axe of hatred and used it against the roots of the Blessed Tree. He brought about joy and exultation amongst the disfigured Yahya community and also brought about happiness and a fresh excitement amongst the despairing enemies of yesteryear. He caused the Stainless Spirit of God to be hurt in the All-highest Paradise and engulfed all the denizens of the cities of eternity in sorrow and wailing and lamenting. He besmirched the name of this Most Holy Religion with the stains of calumniation and obloquy. A new upheaval was enacted. He imprisoned again the Joseph of Baha ['Abdu'l-Baha] He engaged continually in perversion of the Words of God. He created misgivings continuously and spread letters of hellfire all parts night and day. He tore apart the veil of decorum and modesty. He ignited a heartburning fire in the heart of the oppressed Baha'is. The most pure the most gentle heart of the Centre of the Covenant melted as a result of his wrongdoing He used to weep all the while from his pain and lamentings. The most pure, the most gentle heart of the Centre of the Covenant melted as a result of this wrongdoing. He used to weep all the while from his pain and lamentations. In numerous Tablets and diverse prayers the Pen of the Covenant hath continually moved in description of the His sorrows caused by that Breaker of the Covenant of the Luminary of all the World some of which will be mentioned here. So much was I afflicted with sorrow that I spent all night in wailing and communing with God So burning was the fever created by My pain that in the morning a most strange effect was visible in My face from the burn. It became obvious to Me that My pain has hurt My liver so that some of its consequence was visible on My face Now O ye who seek to discover the secrets of the Divine! O ye who support the Cause of the All-Merciful God! Ponder a little. These afflictive difficulties, these successive assaults these awesome disturbances these various tribulations, these internal rebellions all of which descended upon the Cause of God from the beginning of the divine Religion over ninety years as imposed upon it by both acquaintances and adversaries did any of these at all create a breach in this mighty edifice this strong construction. Could any of these create a disruption or confounding of the foundations of the Shari'ah of God? Nay I swear by the Lord of Might! Dissension did not lead unto schisms. Those seeking rebellion and separatism did not succeed in creating obliteration and dissolution. It may be that certain of those who would fain have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendour did faint away and die and it is true that certain important pillars of this Edifice self-destruct and the majority of the Aghsan [Branches] who were offshoots of the Tree that belongeth neither to the East nor to the West did fall upon the dust of degradation and caught themselves off from the Trunk of the Divine Lote Tree but despite all of this the foundation of this Building was unshaken and unaffected. The Divine Tree could never be uprooted. Deadly toxin could never poison the Fountainhead of this Most Precious Cause. The blasting gales could never afflict the Incomparable Plant. The most incisive sword could not tear the united assemblage created by God. The most ferocious winds failed to quench the Resplendent Candle. Every fair one will testify and every discerning one will confess to this verity: Although in past cycles internal differences, religious disputes, partisan argumentations and antagonisms all would immediately result in permanent schisms and abiding denominations And they would eventuate in big breaches in the fundamentals of the divine Edifice. Then the primal oneness would be lost. The Cause initiated by God would be destroyed and its efficacy enfeebled But in this Supreme Theophany this most consummate and complete Dispensation despite a current of tribulation and a succession of troubles and calamities and the occurrence of unheard of difficulties the Faith of God was providentially vouchsafed protection from those ailments impinging on Past Religions Consider carefully: After the Martyrdom of His Holiness the Spirit of God [Jesus Christ] and His Ascension to the Supreme Concourse the divergences of opinion amongst the disciples generated dissensions and all the dissensions were progenitors of great schisms in the concourse of Christ's followers. Gradually these breaches intensified. The quarrels and conflicts developed crescendo and ever newer sects and denominations came to be created The leading men of the Oriental and Occidental Churches upraised the banners of revolt vis-a-vis each other. The Religion of God became divided into fissiparous sects. They were all adrift and in dispersion. All these divisions persist to our day. Again: At the commencement of Islam immediately the Sinless and Pure Spirit of His Holiness the seal of the Prophets Muhammad [Upon Him be the choicest salutation and praise!] ascended amongst His companions a grievous difference occurred relating to that most fundamental of their beliefs that is relating to the matter of succession and vicegerency. This difference led to the formation of schisms These schisms generated numerous parties, denominations, and sects. The passage of time did not assuage the intensity of these differences and nothing could impede the permanence of lasting denominationalism and schism. But in this wondrous Dispensation which in all aspects is to be distinguished from the past Shari'ah s and religions even though more than 90 years have elapsed since Effulgent Luminary rose in Persia and in spite of fearful events and mighty afflictions and the apostasy of the relations of the Sacred Tree itself and the revolt of some pillars of the Community, by virtue of most decisive Texts and most firm admonitions and warnings revealed by God and the existence of the unequivocal incontrovertible and firm testaments and the appointment and identification of specific authorities who is the authoritative interpreter of God's Holy Words as a result of all this the unity of the divine Faith was unassailable and the enemies were all brought to extinction and defeat. The sacred institutions and holy ordinances were all sacrosanct from the stain and spoliation of the rebellious and recalcitrant. Differences and disturbances which are the essential prerequisites and sine qua non of growth and evolution of the Body of the Cause did not unlike the past result in the break-up and fracture of the Temple of the Cause. All those difficulties were transformed by God into mechanisms for the purification of its vesture, strengthening of its constituent elements, and the discarding of unhealthy and insalubrious entities from the Community of the People of Baha' . Even though ikhtilaf [ variance, diversity] in the Faith of Him Who vouchsafeth secret Bounties is bound to happen in all ages yet the non occurrence of breakup and schism in the company of the followers of the Light of the World is a distinguishing characteristic of this luminous Cause and of the particularities of this Glorious Dispensation. Where is the misbegotten Karim and his colleagues? Where is Azal and his followers? Where is the Archbreaker and his friends and assistants? Where are their futile plans? Where are their degraded associations? Where are their false promises? Whither are their vain conspiracies? Where is gone their ever vanishing and transient power? All their hopes were brought to nought. All their deeds were of no avail. The angels of retribution beat upon their mouths and hurled them all into the midmost fire. Their story has remained as a lesson for the clear sighted observers . Nothing has remained in the kingdom of God except the lights that radiate from His luminous and incandescent countenance and the traces and effects of His all conquering all pervasive all potent Faith. O ye who seek to praise Greatest Name! This precious and beloved Faith of God is held firmly in the grasp of the One Who is the Luminary of All Existence and the concourse of the People of Baha are held in the protective hand of the Absolutely All-Possessing One! His Unseen Hand worketh ever more. All earthly turmoil and revolution is but the start of the proclamation of Divine Shari'ah . The rays emanating from the heaven of confirmation are truly dazzling and the signs of the grandeur of the Cause evident far and near. This Day is that fearful aforementioned Day of Separation [ Qur'an 44:40, 77:13, 78:17] and all things give the glad tidings of that Golden Age of The Cycle of the Lord of Destiny. A seeing eye is essential if one wishes to behold the lights of this Day and to assimilate and appreciate these heretofore unknown verities. Who can flee from His Sovereignty? Who can escape from His Authority? Who can fail not to be conquered by His Victory? The events and vicissitudes of the first Baha' i Century are the pivotal points for drawing lessons in relation to future events They are the clear mirror for seeing the future transpiring. Consider again After the passing of our Kind Father Abdu'l-Baha the Centre of the Covenant, [May My spirit be a sacrifice to His lovers!] certain degraded and vain unfaithful ones and the chief of all of these the Great Raven, the Redolent Droplet, the miserable Avarih, these caused what an uproar what foul noises were raised by them! What nonsensical ravings were disseminated by them! What plottings were conceived by them! What staunch effort they exerted! In order that the Sacred Cord of the Divine Testament be broken apart and a breach be created in the divine Guardianship! So that what the wicked groups of the past failed to achieve they may be able to accomplish. But God did cut off their tongue. And soon will God cause them to join the company of those who acted unjustly in the past and waxed vainglorious. Then they will learn their true abode!

<p>	O friends of God!
<p>	I adjure you to remain steadfast on this awesome Cause.
<p>	I adjure you to defend its Holy sacraments
<p>	I adjure you to summon mankind to this Great announcement and to implement its glorious Laws
<p>	I adjure you to follow this Broad and Straight Path

<p>	I adjure you to lay firm its foundations and to persist in unravelling its mysteries, and to continue avoiding and shunning every one who is an enemy of this Unique scintillating and all Glorious Name In this wise will your stations become disclosed unto you. The lights of your glory will then shine and darkness will thereby be dispelled from your lands. All the hidden matters latent in the Cause will thereby be revealed and your enemies will be vanquished and all the promises of your Lord and Master will be fulfilled. Your country will then become a portion of the most exalted Paradise and a mirror reflecting the lights radiating from the Abha Kingdom All Glory to this Approaching Day, a Day all Effulgent, Most Holy, Most Blessed, Most Great.
