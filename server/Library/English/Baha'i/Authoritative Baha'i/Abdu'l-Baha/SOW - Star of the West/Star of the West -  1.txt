The "Purest Branch"
In reproducing the photograph of the "Purest Branch" so lovingly sent by the maid-servant of God, Fareeza Khánum, to the friends in the Occident, the following extracts from the "Life and Teachings
page 2
of 'Abbás Effendi" ('Abdu'l-Bahá), by Myron H. Phelps, relating how the "Purest Branch" came to his death, will be of interest:
"We were imprisoned in the barracks, without any substantial change in our manner of life, for two years.  During this time none of us left the prison.  One evening towards the end of the second year, my younger brother came, as was his habit, to write for his Father.  But as he was not very well, and as others of the family were also ill, the Blessed Perfection (Bahá'u'lláh) told him to go and come later.  So he went up to the flat roof of the barracks, where we were accustomed to walk, and which was our only recourse for fresh air and exercise.  He was walking up and down repeating Tablets and gazing at the sky, when he stumbled, lost his balance, and fell through the opening to which the ladder from below led up.  The room into which he fell had a lofty ceiling; it was the living-room of the family.  No one was in the room at the time, but hearing his cries, some of the family rushed in and found him in a heap on the floor with the blood pouring from his mouth.
"We took him up and laid him on his mat.  He was perfectly conscious.  Later the Blessed Perfection came and remained with him.  The, physician was sent for; he said that there was no hope.
"My brother lived for thirty hours.  When he was about to pass away the Blessed Perfection said to him:  'What do you desire?  Do you wish to live, or do you prefer to die?  Tell me what you most wish for.'  My brother replied:  'I don't care to live.  I have but one wish.  I want the believers to be admitted to see their Lord.  If you will promise me this, it is alt I ask.'  The Blessed Perfection told him that it would be as he desired.
"The death of this youngest and favourite child of a very gentle and sweet disposition-nearly broke his mother's heart.  We feared for her reason.  When the Blessed Perfection was told of the condition of his wife, he went to her and said:  'Your son has been taken by God that His people might be free His life was the ransom, and you should rejoice that you had a son so dear to give to the Cause of God.'  When our mother heard these words she seemed to rally, and after that she did not shed tear."

Tablet by Bahá'u'lláh
A tablet by Bahá'u'lláh to the Persian Zoroastrian Bahá'ís.  Revealed in the purest old Persian language, without an Arabic word in it.
IN THE NAME OF GOD THE PEERLESS!
Glory is due unto God, the Discoverer, who, through one shower of the ocean of His Generosity, expanded the firmament of existence, begemmed it with the stars of knowledge and summoned the people to the most high court of perception and understanding!
This shower, which is the Primal Word of the Almighty, is sometimes called the Water of Life, for it quickens the dead souls in the desert of ignorance with the spring of intelligence.  Sometimes it is called the First Emanation which appears from the Sun of Wisdom, and when it began to shine the first movement became manifest and known; then phenomena stepped into the arena of existence and these appearances were through the generosity of the incomparable, the Wise One.  He is the Knower, the Giver!  He is sanctified and holy above every statement and attribute!  The seen and the unseen fail to attain the measure of His understanding.  The world of being and whatever has issued from it bears witness to this utterance.
Therefore, it has become known that the First Bestowal of the Almighty is the Word.  The receiver and acceptor of it is the understanding.  It is the First Instructor in the University of Existence and it is the Primal Emanation of God.  Whatever has appeared is through the reflection of its Light and whatever is manifested is the appearance of its Wisdom.  All the names originate in His Name and the beginnings and endings of all affairs are in His Hand.
Your letter came to this Captive of the world in this prison.  It brought happiness and increased friendship; it renewed the remembrance of the former times.  Thanks belong to the Possessor of the Universe, who permitted us to meet in the land of Persia.  We met, we conversed and we listened.  It
page 6
is hoped that no forgetfulness shall follow that meeting, that the revolving of the wheel of time shall not take away its remembrance from the heart and that the plants of love shall grow out of that which is sown and become green, verdant and imperishable.
You have asked regarding the heavenly Books:  the pulse of the universe is in the hand of the skilful Physician.  He diagnoses the illness and wisely prescribes the remedy.  Every day has its own secret and every tongue a melody.  The illness of today has one cure and that of tomorrow another.  Look ye upon this day; consider and discuss its needs.  One sees that existence is afflicted with innumerable diseases compelling it to lie upon the bed of suffering.  Men who are intoxicated with the wine of self-contemplation prevent the wise Physician from reaching it.  Thus have they made themselves and the world to suffer.  They know not the ailment nor recognize the cure.  They take the wrong for the right, the crooked for the straight, the enemy for the friend.
Hearken ye to the melody of this Prisoner!  Stand up and proclaim!  Perchance those who are asleep may awaken!  Say, O ye dead ones!  The generous Hand of the Almighty is passing around the Water of Eternal Life.  Hasten ye and drink!  Whosoever becomes alive in this day shall never die, and whosoever dies in this day can never find Life.2
Ye have written regarding the language:  Both Persian and Arabic are good, for that which one desires to gain from language is to attain to the meanings of the speaker and this can be accomplished in both.  As in this day the Sun of Wisdom has appeared and shone forth from the horizon of Persia, the more you respect this language the better it is.
O Friend!  When the Primal Word appeared in these latter days, a number of the heavenly souls heard the Melody of the Beloved and hastened toward it, while others finding that the deeds of some did not correspond with their words, were prevented from the splendors of the Sun of Knowledge.
Say, O ye sons of earth!  The Pure God proclaims that which in this glorious day shall purify you
page 7
from the stains of desire and enable you to attain to tranquillity in My straight path and My manifest road.  To be severed from attachment means to be separated from those things which occasion loss and lessen the grandeur of man.  If the people of the world should attain to the Heavenly Utterances they would never be prevented from the Ocean of Divine Generosity.
The heaven of righteousness has no Star, and never shall have one, brighter than this.  The first Utterance of the Wise One is this:  O ye Sons of Earth!  Turn from the night of foreignness to the shining of the Sun of Unity.  This is that which shall benefit the people of the world more than aught else.
O Friend!  The Tree of the Word has no better Blossom and the Ocean of Wisdom shall never have a brighter Pearl than this:  O ye Sons of Intelligence!  The thin eyelid prevents the eye from seeing the world and what is contained therein.  Then think of the result when the curtain of greed covers the sight of the heart.
Say, O People!  The darkness of greed and envy obscures the light of the soul as the cloud prevents the penetration of the sun's rays.  Should one listen with the ear of intelligence to this Utterance, he shall spread the wings of freedom and soar with great joy toward the heaven of understanding.
When the world was environed with darkness, the Sea of Generosity was set in motion and Divine Illumination appeared so that the deeds were disclosed.  This is the same illumination which is promised in the heavenly books.  Should the Almighty desire the hearts of the people of the world, He will purify and sanctify them with the power of the Word, and will pour forth the Light of the Sun of Unity upon the souls to regenerate the world.
O People!  The word must be demonstrated by the deed, for the righteous witness of the Word is action.  The former without the latter shall not allay the thirst of the needy nor open the door of sight to the blind.
The Heavenly Wise One proclaimeth:  A harsh word is like a sword, but gentle speech is like unto milk.  The children of the world attain to knowledge and better themselves through this.  The tongue of Wisdom says:  Whosoever possesses Me
page 8
not, has nothing.  Pass by whatever exists in this world and find Me.  I am the Sun of Perception and the Ocean of Science.  I revive the withered ones and quicken the dead.  I am that Light which illumines the path of Insight.  I am the Falcon of the Hand of the Almighty; I bear healing in My wings and teach the knowledge of soaring to the Heaven of Truth.
The Peerless Beloved says:  The way of freedom is opened!  Hasten ye!  The Fountain of Knowledge is gushing!  Drink ye!  Say O friends!  The Tabernacle of Oneness is raised; look not upon each other with the eye of strangeness.  Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.3  Truly, I say, whatever lessens ignorance and increases knowledge, that has been, is and shall be accepted by the Creator.
Say, O People!  Walk ye under the shade of the Tree of Righteousness; enter ye under the protection of the Tent of Unity.  Say, O thou Possessor of Sight!  The past is the mirror of the future; look and perceive.  Perchance, after the acquirement of knowledge ye may know the Friend and attain to his good pleasure.  Today the best fruit of Tree of Science and Knowledge is that which benefits mankind and improves his condition.
Say! the tongue is the witness of My Truth; do not pollute it with untruthfulness.  The spirit is the treasury of My Mystery; do not deliver it into the hand of greed.  It is hoped that in this Dawn the universe shall become illumined with the rays of the sun of understanding and knowledge, so that we may attain to the good pleasure of the Beloved and drink from the Ocean of Divine Recognition.
O Friend!  As there were few ears to hear, so for some time the Pen has been silent in its own chamber and to such a degree that silence has preceded utterance.  Say, O People!  Words are revealed according to capacity, so that the beginners may make progress.  The milk must be given according to the measure, so that the babe of the world may enter into the realm of grandeur and be established in the Court of Unity.
O Friend!  We have seen the pure ground and cast the seed of knowledge.  Now it depends upon the rays of the sun whether it burns up or is caused to grow.  Say, today, through the greatness [p. 9] of the Peerless, Wise One, the Sun of Knowledge has appeared from behind the covering of the Spirit and all the birds of the meadow of oneness are intoxicated with the wine of Understanding and are commemorating the Name of the Beloved.  Happy is the one who finds this and becomes immortal.

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár
O ye friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful!
If it is your intention to have the general Convention in Chicago on the day of Naw-Rúz, so that delegates might be sent there from everywhere to deliberate and discuss matters pertaining to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, to proclaim the oneness of the kingdom of humanity, to explain the Divine Teachings and to elucidate and expound the Exhortations of the Blessed Perfection,-it is better to open this Convention during the Feast of Ridván; for the Feast of Ridván is greater and more important and the temperature at that time mild and balmy.  Therefore, proclaim ye to all parts that all the delegates and friends gather in Chicago during that blessed day.
Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Revealed and sent to all parts of the world.
HE IS GOD!
Praise be unto Thee, O my God!  Thanks be unto Thee O my Beloved!  Glory be unto Thee, O my Lord! for that which Thou hast bestowed, favoured, conferred and granted.  For Thou hast chosen sincere servants from among Thy people to serve Thy Religion.  Thou hast elected them to draw inspiration from Thy Manifest Light, attraction from Thy Luminous Beauty and to walk in Thy straight path.  O my Lord!  Verily the souls are heedless of Thy mentioning and hearts deprived of Thy love, the eyes veiled from beholding the Kingdom of Thy Beauty and the intellects wandering away from the Centre of Thy Glory, except those who are firm in Thy Covenant, free from dissension, attracting the rays of the Sun of Truth, detaching themselves from disharmony, arising in the service of Thy Cause amongst Thy people and exhilarated from the pure wine of Thy Kingdom.  Bestow upon them unlimited blessing and creative good from the never-ending Bounty, and pour upon them with great abundance, from the Cloud of Thy Majesty, the rain of Thy Grace, the water of Thy Generosity and the Universal Favour.
O Lord, suffer them to become the signs of Thy Guidance, the standards of the Realm of Might, the words of virtue, the army of the Supreme Concourse and the angels of heaven, so that through them the East and the West of the earth may become Illumined, Thy Name be mentioned in the North and South, that they may educate all races and communities and clothe them with the garment of the comely names and the perfect example in this realm of existence.
page 2
O my Lord, reveal through them the ensign of Unity among mankind and the flag of Love between nations, so that multiplicities may converge into the centre of oneness and harmony, the veils of hatred be rent asunder, the conditions of discord pass away and enmity and rancour vanish from the world of man, So that after disunion the Beloved of Union shall unveil her countenance, animosity be changed into affection, the reign of faction and feud come to an end, and success and prosperity be attained.
O my Lord, strengthen their backs in their service, gird up their loins in their adoration, dilate their breasts with the light of Thy Knowledge, illumine the eyes by beholding Thy Face, gladden their spirits by the significances of thy Providence and purify their souls by the appearance of Thy Compassion.  Verily Thou art the Merciful, the Clement, the Almighty, the Bestower, the Unconstrained!  There is no God but Thee, the Giver, the Pardoner, the Hidden, the Manifest and the Source of Bounties!
O ye friends of God!  Joy and happiness of the people of faithfulness consists in serving the Threshold of the Most High and turning their faces to the Kingdom of Abhá.  The hope of the lovers is self-sacrifice, and the yearning of the longing ones Is self-effacement and evanescence.  For love is an irresistible power and an inextinguishable conflagration and the mirror of the love of God is the great martyrdom.  Therefore, the sanctified souls and the Manifestations of God yearned for self-abnegation and attainment to the city of martyrdom.  They gave up their lives, experienced exile and banishment, endured persecution and dire calamities, became subject to imprisonment and bondage and the targets of the arrows of oppression, and objects of the sword of malice.  They did not complain, neither did they become disheartened.  They drank the cup of martyrdom from the Hand of the Cup-Bearer of Providence, and tasted with the greatest joy the sweetness of annihilation.  They found not a moment of rest.  They sought not an instant of tranquillity.  They withstood the persecution of
page 3
the enemies and became the centres of derision and scoffing of the people of envy.  They sacrificed their homes and property and became homeless and wanderers.  They experienced not one hour of safety, nor a day of repose of mind or body.  This is the proof of the sincere lover and this is the evidence of the faithful friend.  If it were not so every stranger would become a friend and the deprived one would become the confidant of the mysteries, the remote one would become the near one and the outcast would become the beloved.  Consequently the Most Great Wisdom has ordained that the fire of tests shall rage and the rushing torrent of ordeals sweep tumultuously from the Mountain of Revelation, so that the untruthful may become distinguished from the truthful, the unrighteous be known from the righteous, the worshipper of self become separated from the worshipper of God, the good fruit be set apart from the evil fruit, the signs of light become manifest and the gloom of darkness be dispelled, the nightingale of trustworthiness sing the melody of love and the raven of oppression croak the discordant notes of error; the fertile soil become green and verdant and the barren ground produce its thorns and thistles; the attracted ones to the Breath of Abhá become firm and the follower of passion and desire turn away.  This is the wisdom of trials and this is the cause of ordeals.
O ye friends of God!  In these days the city of Tabríz has become red with the blood of mankind.  Holy souls from among the believers of God sacrificed their lives in the path of Manifest Light.  They hastened to the altar of love.  Eyes are weeping on this account, hearts are burning for these events, lamentation and moaning is ascending to the apex of the Supreme Concourse and great grief and intense mourning is experienced.  It is the utmost yearning of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to drink from this cup of martyrdom and become exhilarated with the wine of sacrifice, so that the end of his life shall become the opening chapter of Divine Bounty.  O my Lord, confer upon me that overflowing cup with the most great gift!  Intoxicate me with that wine of the glorious favour and suffer me to partake of that food which cannot be tasted except by Thy
page 4
faithful servant.  Crown my head with this refulgent diadem, cause my blood to be shed in Thy Cause, my body to be suspended between heaven and earth, this temple to be dismembered and its bones be disjoined by the arrows of the enemies.
O ye friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!  In these days, through the happy circumstances and the confirmation of the Lord of the Supreme Heavens and the assistance of the Unseen Kingdom, the holy remains of His highness the Supreme (Báb) were transferred to the Mount of Carmel in Haifa in the present Tomb.  Therefore, it is necessary for the believers to celebrate the occasion with joy and happiness.  The believers in Tabríz became exhilarated with this cup and with the polo of magnanimity carried away the ball of service from the arena of the Cause.  Perhaps later on the people of hatred and enmity, may calumniate and misrepresent the facts, stating that the blessed remains of the Báb are in some other place, or that a part of it is elsewhere.  The friends of God must know that this is a pure falsehood, calumny and malicious slander.  That blessed, crucified body is interred in its entirety on Mount Carmel, but the enemies will not rest quiet.  It is certain that they will raise a clamour and claim that we stole that blessed body, or fraudulently transferred it or got hold of a part of it, or that the genii took it away from the firm ones.  All these statements are fabrications and slanders.  The whole truth is explained here.  Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár
Through Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb, to the maid-servant of God who is firm in the Covenant, Mrs Corinne True (Upon her be Bahá'u'lláh!), Chicago, Illinois:
HE IS GOD!
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!
Thy letter, dated 6 January 1910, was received with the enclosed papers.
Regarding the appointment of the time for the opening of the general convention in Chicago, this matter is already written about.  Undoubtedly you have received it by this time.  It was suggested to postpone the 20 March to the days of Ridván, in which the climate is temperate.
You have written regarding the election of delegates from among the Oriental Bahá'ís.  The season for this work has not yet come.  God willing, in its opportune time they will be sent.
Several plans and designs of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár have been received from America.  Now the believers must display an endeavour so that the land may he bought in its entirety; then collect contributions for the building, and then they may think about the plans.  So far the means are lacking.  I hope from the favour of the True One that sufficient and ample contribution may be gathered and afterward the best and most acceptable plans be decided upon.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá,

Prayer
A prayer read by Mr Mountfort Mills, 25 April 1910-it is identical except for capitalization to Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, Vol. I, pp. 2-3.
O my God!  O my God!  We are servants who have sincerely turned our faces unto Thy grand face, severed ourselves from all else save Thee in this great day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting, of one accord and desire, and unanimous in thought to promulgate Thy Word amid Thy creatures.
O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Suffer us to be signs of guidance, standards of Thy manifest Religion throughout the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant-O our exalted Lord!-appearances of Thy oneness in Thy Kingdom, the Abhá, and stars which dawn forth unto all regions.
O Lord!  Make us as seas rolling with the waves of Thy great abundance, rivers flowing from the mountains of Thy glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on the tree of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved by the breeze of Thy gift in Thy wonderful vineyard.
O Lord!  Cause our souls to depend upon the signs of Thy Oneness, our hearts to be dilated with the boun-
page 8
ties of Thy Singleness, so that we may become united as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as are the rays which shine forth from a brilliant light; so that our thoughts, opinions and feelings become as one reality from which the spirit of accord may be diffused throughout all regions.
Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Bestower!  Verily Thou art the Giver, the Mighty, the Loving, the Merciful!

The following Tablet, sent by 'Abdu'l-Bahá for this Convention, was then read by Mrs Eva Webster Russell:
HE IS GOD!
Through his honour Dr Faríd,
To the beloved of God in America.
Upon them be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!
Praise be to God!  The infinite bounty of God hath resuscitated the whole world, and the East and the West have come united with the bond of the summons of God.
Today the call of the Kingdom of God hath reached the hearing of the far and near of all the continents of the world and the standard of the solidarity of Mankind is held aloft by the grasp of Divine Power.
The melody of the East has made joyous and happy the Western world, and the song of the West has penetrated the ears of the Eastern people.
From inception of the world until now there has been no uniting bond between Persia and America, and communication and correspondence never transpired between these two countries.  Now consider what a joy and bliss have united these two regions in the shortest space of time!  What a real and ideal tie hath bound these together!  What spiritual communications have been revealed!  And now is only the beginning of this early morn and this is only the result of the twilight preceding the dawn.  Soon will the star of this unity shine forth and flood all the horizons with its light and perfect connection and real oneness be obtained in all the regions of the earth.  But the speedy realization of these hopes is dependent upon this:  That the beloved of God in the West shall arise in unison with perfect strength, girding the loins of endeavour in service and putting forth their greatest effort in the way of unity and love.  They must not rest a moment nor take a breath of ease.  Nay, rather, night and day must they be striving, working and serving!  And with perfect severance, spirituality and the best intent and effort must they hasten to promulgate the Divine Teaching, and above all they must act according to the precepts and exhortations of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, for in this cycle of Bahá'u'lláh verbal confessions and acknowledgements, literal faith and certainty and external relations are of no avail.  Nay, rather, the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful must manifest such attributes and ethical conduct as to embody and personify the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh.  They must promulgate the law
page 9
of the Kingdom with deeds and not words.  Thus may they become the quintessence of being, the signs of the Kingdom of God, standards of the Supreme Concourse.  May ye be salutary water for the thirsty, an evidence of guidance for the seeker, protection and support for the helpless, a shelter and home for the wanderers, the treasury of the Kingdom for the poor; the source of hope and happiness for the disappointed; the remedy of the heart and soul for the ailing.  May you manifest the utmost of kindness to the human race; to weep with him who mourneth and to laugh with him who rejoiceth; sympathizing with the helpless; in communion with the wanderer; a friend to the friend and foe.
O ye beloved of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!  The beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful intend to found a Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Chicago.  They have sent to us numerous plans, that one may be accepted and the edifice be built accordingly.  Now the funds must be accumulated, the land entirely paid for and the necessary preparations for building made and then the accessory matters considered.  Therefore, make ye an effort and show ye zeal that the price of the land be fully discharged and the means for the edifice procured.
The beloved in the East are striving with heart and soul to contribute to the best of their ability, although the internal conditions of Persia have, during the last few years, been exceedingly disturbed.  This revolution affected all conditions and walks of life.  There has been no agriculture, no trade and no commerce; nay, rather, in all the provinces there have been political disputes and quarrels between the two parties, namely, the nationalists and the constitutionalists.  Thus, they have been wholly occupied with their own affairs.  Notwithstanding this, they have striven to contribute to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Chicago according to their best ability, and they will never be found wanting!  If Persia should obtain order, the beloved there will make a worthy contribution.
And I supplicate the Kingdom of God to aid and confirm you.
Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

"Mutual helpfulness-co-operation-confirmation"4
"Without the complete establishment of this divine principle in the hearts of the friends of God, nothing can be accomplished"
To his honour Amín [one of the venerable teachers of the East], Tihrán, Persia:
Upon him be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O thou spiritual Amín!
In all the world of creation all the existent beings are in the utmost connection.  Through this connection, mutual helpfulness and co-operation is realized.  This mutual helpfulness and co-operation is the origin of the conservation of the forces of life.  If for one instant this mutual helpfulness and co-operation were cut off from the sources and realities of things, all the existent beings and things would be thrown into confusion and chaos, and be reduced to nothingness and annihilation.
For instance:  From the breath of the animals a watery element, called hydrogen and carbon is exhaled, and this is the life principle of the vegetable kingdom.  From the vegetable kingdom and the trees, a fiery element, called oxygen, is emitted and this becomes the cause of the maintenance of the life of the animal kingdom.  In such a manner, mutual helpfulness and co-operation is realized continually between all the existent beings.
Likewise, the greatest inter-relation
page 14
and communication exists between the sons of men, without which peace, life and existence is entirely impossible.  For a soul independent of all the other souls and without receiving assistance from other sources cannot live for the twinkling of an eye; nay, rather, he will become non-existent and reduced to nothingness; especially among the believers of God between whom material and spiritual communication is developed up to the highest point of perfection.
It is this real communication, the essential necessity and requirement of which is mutual helpfulness, co-operation and confirmation.  Without the complete establishment of this divine principle in the hearts of the friends of God, nothing can be accomplished, for they are the hyacinths of one garden; the waves of one sea, the stars of one heaven and the rays of one sun.  From every standpoint, the essential unity, the luminous unity, the religious unity and the material unity are founded and organized between them.
In these times the utmost hope and wish of the friends of the West is the erection of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, and in those regions the materials for construction and building are expensive and costly.  A large sum of money is needed for the building of a residence; then how much more is needed for the foundation of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár which must be erected with the utmost splendour, beauty and magnificence!
Therefore, the friends of God must arise in every part of the world to raise contributions, and with their hearts and souls strive to gather these funds to be sent to the Occident that it may become known and evident throughout the universe that the Bahá'ís of the East and West are as members of one household and the children of the one Lord!  The Turks and the Persian, the Parsí and the American, the Hindu and the African-all of them are one army and one cohort-and without any distinction they arise for the assistance and aid of each other.
This praiseworthy movement is beloved and accepted at the Threshold of the Forgiving Lord.  Truly, I say, in the erection of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Ishqabád [Russia], the friends of God have laid the foundation of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity and they worked nobly together until now, and it is nearly completed.  Praise be to God, that at this moment from every country in the world, according to their various means, contributions are continually being sent toward the fund of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in America.
Convey the gratitude of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to all the friends of God in this service.
In reality this magnanimity of the believers is worthy of great praise and thankfulness, for from Tihrán, Khúristán, Shíráz, Jahram, Isfahán, even from the towns and villages of Khúristán, Shíráz, and Yazd, contributions were sent.  This donation in the path of the Orb of Regions is conducive of the happiness of the souls of the spiritual ones.
From the day of Adam until now such an event has never even been witnessed by man, that from the farthermost country of Asia contributions were forwarded to the farthermost country of America.  From Rangoon, India, donations are sent to Chicago, and from Jahram, a little village of Shíráz and Kheirol-Gora of Tarshiz,
page 15
money is transmitted for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in America.  This is through the bounty and providence of the Blessed Perfection [Bahá'u'lláh], the assistance and confirmation of the Sun of Truth, and the victory and triumph of the Luminary of Effulgence, who has united so marvellously the regions of the world together.  Glory belongs to the Lord of Hosts!  Sovereignty belongs to the Compassionate God!  Power and Might belongs to the Living, Self-subsistent One who has united the people of the world and assembled them together like unto the brilliant stars of the horizon of adoration.
O my God!  O my God!  Favour belongs to Thee, Generosity belongs to Thee!  Praise belongs to Thee and Glorification is Thine, for that which Thou hast bestowed upon these indigent ones, granted a refuge and asylum to these weak ones in the cave of Thy protection and preservation, assisted them in the service of Thy Cause and confirm them in the worship of Thy Exalted Threshold.  O Lord!  They have sacrificed their belongings and souls in Thy path, contributed for love of Thee and missed no chance or opportunity in spreading Thy Signs, diffusing Thy Word, promulgating Thy Name among Thy servants and proclaiming Thy wonders among Thy creatures!
Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Most High, the Omnipresent; and verily Thou art the Clement and the Most Merciful!

Extract from a Tablet to his honour Ibn-i-Ábhar5
Explain to the people the details of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Chicago and tell them how contributions are received from the East and the West.  For example, at this moment four contributions were received in one day from Rangoon, Bombay (India), Jahram of Shíráz and Kheirol-Gora of Khurásán for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of America and were forwarded to their destination.
Truly, I say, the friends of God displayed wonderful generosity in regard to the contributions for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár.  They displayed magnanimity at any cost to such an extent that some of them sold portions of their clothing on the streets.  This is through the Power of the Covenant of God, for until this day an event of this character has never transpired that from the East and Asia contributions were forwarded to the West for the building of a Temple.  Verily this is a cause of astonishment for the people of perception.

Prayer
[Prayer read at the opening of the convention session on Tuesday 26 April 1910]
Glory be to Thee, my God and my Beloved!  Thy Fire is burning in me, O my Lord, and I feel its glowing in every member of my weak body.  Every organ of my temple declares Thy Power and Thy Might, and every member testifies that Thou are powerful over all things.  By Thy Strength I feel strong to withstand all trials and all temptations.  Make firm Thy love in my heart and then I can bear all the swords of the earth.  Verily every hair of my head says, "were it not for trials in Thy Path, I should not have appreciated Thy Love." O my Lord, strengthen me to remain firm and to uphold they hands of Thy Cause, to serve Thee among Thy people.  Thou art loving!  Thou art Bountiful!

O ye discerning ones of the people!  Verily the Words which have descended from the Heaven of the Will of God are the source of unity and harmony for the world.  Close your eyes to racial differences and welcome all the with the light of Oneness.  Be the cause of comfort and promotion of humanity.  This handful of dust, the world, is one home; let it be in unity.  forsake pride, it is the cause of discord.  Follow that which tends to harmony.

O God O God!  Thou dost look upon us from Thine unseen Kingdom of Oneness, [beholding] that we have assembled in this Spiritual Meeting, believing in Thee, confident in Thy signs, firm in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted unto Thee, set aglow with the fire of Thy love, sincere in Thy Cause, servants in Thy vineyard, spreaders of Thy Religion, worshippers of Thy Countenance, humble to Thy beloved, submissive at Thy door and imploring Thee to confirm us in the service of Thy chosen ones.  Support us with Thine unseen hosts, strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and make us submissive and worshipping servants, communing with Thee.
O our Lord!  We are weak and Thou are the Mighty, the Powerful!  We are mortals and Thou art the great life-giving Spirit!  We are needy and Thou art the Powerful and Sustainer!
O our Lord!  Turn our faces unto Thy divine face; feed us from Thy heavenly table by Thy godly grace; help us through the hosts of Thy supreme angels and confirm us by the holy ones of the Kingdom of 'Abhá.

O ye Spiritual Friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!
How long are ye silent and speechless!  Although ye are speaking, yet in this age the speech of the believers of God must be the soul entrancing melody of the Kingdom of 'Abhá and the harmony of the Supreme Concourse!  Therefore 'Abdu'l-Bahá is not satisfied with a meek voice and depressing lamentation!  He seeks the passionate tumult and joyous clamour and he roars and cries at the top of his voice so that the realities of things may stir into movement and action and the Beloved of Bounty unveil her Countenance in the world of creation!  Those friends must, like unto the stars in heaven, shine and gleam in the horizon of Truth with the Light of Guidance so that the realities of the existent beings and the spirit of humankind may find joy and happiness!
Upon ye be greeting and praise!

School of Tarbíyat
As to the School of Tarbíyat, the following Tablets have been revealed:
There exists a great Confirmation in the School of Tarbíyat which is founded by the friends.  Although at this moment it is observed but by a few, yet it is assisted by the Almighty.  If the believers of God display generosity, that school will progress day by day in all its grades.  Encouragement and stimulus is necessary.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
The problem of the School of Tarbíyat is of the utmost importance.  It is an essential obligation and duty incumbent upon all the friends to serve that school.  This is, the first school that the friends have founded in Persia, and all the people know that it belongs to them.  Neglect and carelessness in the management of its progressive affairs is a blow to the Cause of God.  Therefore everyone must give extraordinary importance to the school of Tarbíyat and assist it from some standpoint either through enlightened ideals or the introduction of modern system of education, either by liberal contributions or continual encouragement and assistance.  To be brief:  It is the hope of this Servant that in the course of time this school become distinguished from among all the schools of the world.  Now consider how important is this matter.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
The question of the School of Tarbíyat is very important.  Through the Bounty and Providence of the True One it must become evident to all that it is the first school of Persia and its graduates are the most successful.  Otherwise its non-being is better than its being.  Therefore display the utmost zeal in matters pertaining to the progress of this school.

The Society has received the approval of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the following Tablets having been revealed recently, addressed to Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb and to the officers of the Society respectively:
To his honour Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb.
Upon him be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
In the last two mails detailed answers have been written to thee.  Now the papers that you have forwarded pertaining to the Persian-American Educational Society have been received.  Truly I say, although the importance of this Society at present, is apparently unknown, but if it remain firm and steadfast in the future it will become the Association of the union of the realm of man, it will thoroughly combine and harmonize the East and the West and accomplish a great service to humanity. ...
page 4
The believers of God must give great importance to this Society and arise to perform its fundamental principles and essential duties with heart and soul.  I send my congratulation and felicitation to this blessed Society and ask from the bounty of His Highness the Incomparable confirmation and assistance, supplicate and entreat at the Threshold of Oneness and beg from the Kingdom of Abhá preservation and protection, providence and safety.  If this Society acts with independence and exerts itself in bringing about relations between the East and the West, it will become the foundation of the oneness of the world of humanity.  Firmness is essential, for if small affairs can not be accomplished without firmness and steadfastness, how much more are these qualities needed for the undertaking of great matters!  The friends of God must encourage each other to be firm and steadfast, to reason and consult with each other so that day by day this Society will progress.
Persia and America are in great need of such a Society, even to matters pertaining to material relations between these two Countries, especially America.  This Society will become the cause of spreading the American industries in Persia and the great profits, which in the past other nations have collected through the introduction of their goods and implements in Persia, will then go to America.  Now consider thou, what great profits will be the result!  Moreover the spiritual powers will assist and help, the Breaths of the Holy Spirit will be spread, the Breezes of the Paradise of Abhá diffused and the rays of the Sun of Truth will display wonderful influence.
Convey, on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, to all the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful in America the wonderful greeting of Abhá and congratulate and felicitate them for the organization of this Society.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

O ye who are favoured in the Threshold of the Almighty and the lovers of His Holiness, Bahá'u'lláh!
According to the reports of his honour Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb, in these days the Persian-American Educational Society is organized in America and the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful with the utmost zeal and enthusiasm are engaged in the solidarity of this Society.  If possible, change the name of this Society to Persian-American Interdependence Society so that in the future it may include all points, such as commerce, industry and education so that spiritual and material results and benefits might be produced.  Now in the beginning it may find no im-
page 5
portance in the eyes of some of the people but in the future it will attain to world-wide celebrity and it will indicate that-Praise be to God-at this early period the friends have directed their thoughts to this most important subject.  Should the circle of this Society be widely extended and its various branches well organized and systematized it will remain firm and become established and if its members arise with perfect unity and agreement, know ye of a certainty that at the end it will become the greatest Society of the world, produce inexhaustible results and benefits, become the tree of the oneness of the realm of humanity and cast its all-encircling shade over the people of the East and the West.  But firmness and firmness, steadfastness and steadfastness is necessary.  This Society must be so organized and in the course of time its various policies so well defined, that since the beginning of the world until now no such association has ever been founded.  This must become the first society embracing such universal aims and objects.  'Abdu'l-Bahá with the utmost supplication and contemplation towards the Kingdom of Abhá, prays in your behalf and begs confirmation and assistance.
Blessed is the Oriental-Occidental Interdependence Society!  If it is organized in a befitting manner it will be productive of great results; otherwise it will be fruitless and profitless.
Long live this Society!  Long live this Society!  Undoubtedly at the beginning of every month a report of this Society should be sent to this Holy Land.
O Thou Almighty!  Illumine Thou this Association and make Thou this gathering the bright candle of the world!  For their intention is for the public good and their aim is Service to humankind.
O kind and compassionate God!  Such a Society merits Thy Favours and such a Body deserves inexhaustible Bounty and Providence.
Verily, Thou art Powerful, Mighty and Omnipotent and, verily, Thou art the Peerless and Incomparable God!

it enters the Presence of God in a form which, throughout all centuries, times and throughout all circumstances and events of the world, will remain unchanged, but will he everlasting as the perpetuity of the Kingdom of God, His Sovereignty, His Power and His Might, and from it will appear the traces of God, His Qualities, Providences and Favours.  The Pen cannot move at the mentioning of this Station as it is in its Supremeness and Exaltation!
The hand of the Divine Bounty will cause it to enter into a Station that cannot he comprehended by expression, nor be explained by all the creatures of the existence.  Blessing be upon the spirit who departed from the body purified from the doubts and superstitions of the nations!  Verily, it moves in the atmosphere of God's desire and enters into the Supreme Paradise!  All the angels of the Supreme Paradise attend and surround it, and it will have fellowship with all the Prophets of God and His saints and speak with them and tell them what happened to it in the Cause of God, the Lord of the Universe!
If anyone could realize what hath been assigned for it in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the Throne and the dust, he would immediately yearn with a great longing for that Unmovable, Exalted, Holy and Abhá Station!

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Through his honour Mírzá Ahmad, to Mrs Louise R. Waite, Chicago, Illinois.
HE IS GOD!
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!
Thy letter was considered.  On account of the lack of time, a brief answer is given.
The Spiritual Assembles which are organized for the sake of teaching the Truth, whether assemblies for men, assemblies for women or mixed assemblies, are all accepted and are conducive to the spreading of the Fragrances of God.  This is essential.  Likewise the public meeting in which, one day during the week, the believers gather, to
page 11
be engaged in the commemoration of God, to read communes and deliver effective speeches, is acceptable and beloved.  But now it is utterly impossible to establish the House of Justice, which is mentioned in the Book of Aqdas; nay, rather, it is impracticable and not to be thought of.  That is for the time when the Cause is proclaimed and the Commands of God have become effective.  Therefore, now is not the time for the House of Justice, which must be established by general election.  Its mention is not permissible and its realization impossible.
Endeavour ye as much as possible that differences may not arise in the affairs; let not every insignificant matter become the cause of disagreement.  If such a condition exists, the end will be complete dispersion.
The believers and the maid-servants of the Merciful must all consider how to produce harmony, so that the unity of the human world may be realized; not that every wholly unimportant subject become conducive to differences of opinion.  It is my hope that the friends and maid-servants of America become united on all subjects and not disagree at all, for disagreement destroys the foundation of the Cause of God.  It they agree upon a subject, even though it be wrong, it is better than to disagree and be in the right.  For this difference will produce demolition of the Divine foundation.  Though one of the parties may be in the right and they disagree, that will be the cause of a thousand wrongs; but if they agree and both parties are in the wrong, as it is unity, the truth will be revealed and the wrong made right.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!
Your brief and interesting letter was perused.  Although it was brief, yet in reality it was a detailed book.  Every word was a letter, for it contained the oneness of the realm of humanity, and it was a proof of the oneness and concord among the friends and maid-servants of God.  Today all the communities of the world are engaged in fighting and quarrelling with each other.  There is a religious strife, a sectarian strife, racial bias, patriotism, political contentions, commercial competition, industrial rivalry and a battle to defend their honour.
In reality these strifes are continual, and there is no cessation or interruption thereto.  Now consider ye with what power and strength, love and devotion, union and harmony, happiness and joy
page 3
the friends of God must arise, so that they may reconcile and crystallize together these different fighting and quarrelling communities.  Were it not for the confirmations of the Word of God the realization of these facts would have been impossible and improbable.  But the confirmation of the Kingdom of God, the penetration of the Word of God, the illumination of the Divine Teachings, the instructions and advices of Bahá'u'lláh will solve these problems and ere long the Tabernacle of the Oneness of humanity will be raised in all regions, the beloved will find great rejoicing and beatitude and like unto the luminous stars they will shine from the horizon of sanctity.

Your letter was a rose-garden of significances and from it the fragrance of the Love of God was exhaled.

Your brief letter was an indication of those detailed letters.  It was the essence of truths and contained innumerable meanings.  Therefore, in reality I read in your letter a book, and I felt that all of you are illumined by the light of guidance, are soaring in the infinite sphere of the love of God, like unto the birds singing wonderful melodies in this rose-garden and like unto the nightingale chanting harmonious songs and music.  We expect that day after day this melody will become sweeter, this symphony more wonderful and this song more exquisite.  It is assured that the confirmations of God will assist that gathering to progress; the boundless gifts will increase and illumine all with the light of guidance.

Extracts from a Tablet to a California Believer:
HE IS GOD!
I beg of God that the means of thy composure may be brought about, that thou mayest be released from the fetters of this world, become a nightingale, be freed from the cage of the attachment of this earth and soar heavenward in the atmosphere of joy.
Regarding the use of liquors:  According to the texts of the Book of Aqdas, both light and strong drinks are prohibited.  The reason for this prohibition is that it leads the mind astray and is the cause of weakening the body.  If alcohol were
page 5
beneficial, it would have been brought into the world by the divine creation and not by the effort of man.  Whatever is beneficial for man exists in creation.  Now, it has been proved and is established medically and scientifically that liquors are harmful.
Therefore the meaning of that which is written in the Tablets:  "I have chosen for thee whatsoever is in the heaven and earth", signifies those things which are according to the divine creation and not the things which are harmful.  For instance, poison is one of the things:  now, can we say that poisons are to be used habitually because God has created them for man?  However, spirituous liquors, if prescribed by a physician for the patient and their use is necessary, then they may be used as directed.
In brief, I hope that thou mayest find eternal bliss and receive inexhaustible joy and happiness.  The after effect of drinking is depression, but the wine of the Love of God bestows exaltation of the spirit.

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to the believers of God in Persia
Upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!
HE IS GOD!
O God!  O God!  Verily, verily the reality of Thy Oneness is sanctified above ascent or descent, and the Sun of Thy Singleness is holy above appearance or disappearance.  Thou hast been in the mystery of Thine Identity and the eternality of Thine Existence; moving in the exaltation of Thy Sanctity and the loftiness of Thy Purity.  The souls who penetrate through the facts of life cannot know Thee, and the minds which are imbued with the subtleties of the universe do not apprehend Thee.  Far from the spiders of imagination to weave the web of their weak thoughts in the imperial palaces of Thy Knowledge, and far from the birds of understanding to attempt soaring with their broken wings toward the golden apex of Thine Explanation!  Verily, all the wings of effort are broken and will not reach the glorious heaven of Thy Singleness.  The intellects are bewildered and if they cannot comprehend one verse of the verses of Thine Omnipotence, how then can they perceive Thy Reality which surrounds all things and is not surrounded!  Thy Holy and Sanctified Identity is beyond the knowledge of the wisest and mightiest in the world of emanation!
O Lord!  O Lord!  Deliver the souls from the superstitions, that they may not imagine any disappearance for Thy Lights, any setting for Thy Luminary, any descent for Thy Reality, and any ascent for Thy Identity.  For verily Thou art above all these qualifications and beyond all these attributes.  Thou hast been and forever shalt be in Thine Inaccessible Station and Thine Unattainable Position.  The road is barred and the path is closed.  Thy Proof is Thy Verses and Thy Path is Thy Dominion.
page 2
O Lord!  O Lord!  These souls are righteous, their hearts attracted, their minds enkindled their ears opened, their eyes seeing, their spirits rejoiced, their breasts dilated, their realities contented, their identities, satisfied and their hearts attentive.  They are supplicating toward Thee, turning their faces to Thee, and begging for Thy Mercy.
O Lord!  O Lord!  Enkindle their lamps, ignite their torches, uplift their waves and open to them the Door of Bounty.
O Lord!  Adorn their gardens, beautify their orchards, illumine their faces, confirm their words, hoist their ensigns, commemorate their names, perfect their morals, cleanse their hearts, purify their breasts and glorify their countenances; so that the manifest light may be seen upon their brow, and the Bloom of Paradise in their faces.  Verily, Thou art the Merciful, Thou art the Clement, the Compassionate and the Ancient!
O ye friends of God!  The waves of confirmations are successive and the hosts of assistance are drawn in battle array.  The armies of the Kingdom of Abhá, like unto the waves of the Supreme Concourse, are tumultuous, and the Breezes of Providence wafting from the direction of Grace, rejuvenate with new life every faded and withered soul.  The trees of the Garden of the Covenant are stirred into the utmost cheerfulness and the fruits of the Orchard of the Testament have reached the stage of perfection, sweetness and delicacy.  The Majestic Palm produces luscious dates, and the Luminous Star shines with infinite brightness.  The Zephyrs of the City of God bestow eternal life, and the Divine Wisdom grants spiritual insight.  The Bounties of God are perfected on every side, and the Favours of the Most High have encircled all.  Blessed are you!-and again, blessed are you!-for you have become the object of the Bestowals of the Beauty of Abhá and the Centre of the Revelations of the Mysteries of the Supreme Concourse.
His honour Amín7 has given the utmost praise
page 3
and commendation on behalf of all, saying that-Praise be to God!-all the friends in all parts of Persia are firm in the Covenant, have taken hold of the Testament of His Highness the Merciful; their minds are full of acclamations, their faces illumined, their hearts aspiring and their spirits soaring toward the Realm of Truth, their souls full of glad-tidings and their consciences in infinite happiness.  Day and night they are engaged in spreading the fragrances, and morning and evening they deliver the Word of God.  They are the Signs of Oneness and the Tokens of the Bounties of the Glorious Lord.  They are the bright lamps and incontrovertible proofs.  They are the horizons of knowledge and the hosts of the Supreme Concourse.  In reality he has given the greatest praise and glorification.  On account of this news great happiness was produced in the hearts of the believers, and all are expressing their most wonderful glad-tidings.
I beg of God, that day by day this Fire may consume the world, and this Flame enkindle the earth; this Favour become all-surrounding and this Path straight.  Cast ye into oblivion all signs of attachment and impurity so that all the regions may become sanctified and purified and all the dawning-places shining and illumined.  Then the Paradise of Abhá will be established in the East and in the West, the glorious outpouring of the Majestic Lord, become universal, the principles of the Cause produce results and the structure of the Revelation of Truth reach to the Mansions of the Supreme Heights.

That all may be informed as to what is intended for this institution [of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár], we quote the following from a Tablet revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
I am hopeful by divine bounty and grace that the beloved ones of God may he confirmed in the building of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár and all its accessories, for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár has important accessories which are accounted of the basic foundations.  These are:  School for orphan children Hospital and Dispensary for the poor:  Place for the incapable:  i.e., (Home for the cripple); College for the Higher Scientific Education.
The meaning is this, that in every place:
First a Mashriqu'l-Adhkár must be founded.
Then a School for the Education of orphan children and the poor.
Then the Hospital and Medical Dispensary must be founded.
Then the home of the Cripple.
Then the College of Higher Scientific Education.
page 10
In every city a great Mashriqu'l-Adhkár must be founded after this order.
Now we hope the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár may be founded in Chicago.  After its foundation the important accessories may gradually be founded.

Four Talks of 'Abdu'l-Bahá
To the Editors of the Bahai News:
Mírzá Munírih Zayn has sent me notes taken in Persian and then translated, from four of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's talks given while Mr Struven and I were in Haifa.
page 2
I am enclosing them to you, knowing they will be of value to you in your work.
Talk No. 1 was given shortly after our arrival in Haifa.
Talk No. 2 was given at a feast which 'Abdu'l-Bahá spread in his home, at which there was gathered a throng of believers from many countries and of various religious faiths.
Talk No. 3 was given upon a most memorable occasion, the 68th anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb.  (According to solar reckoning 23 May of the present year was the 66th anniversary of this event, but according to lunar reckoning-still used in some of the Oriental countries-15 May of this present year was the 68th anniversary.)
At an early hour of the day the believers from Haifa and the visiting pilgrims went up to the hospice, situated near the Tomb of the Báb, upon the Mount of Carmel.  When the feast was prepared 'Abdu'l-Bahá served us as we were seated about the table which had twenty-four places.  There was a second service and also a third, there being between sixty and seventy present.  After all had been served then he, himself, partook of food.  As 'Abdu'l-Bahá gave the material food he made the enclosed brief but soul sustaining address.  It was the most impressive meal that one could possibly imagine.  Any description of mine would not give any idea of the spirit manifested.  Not only were there the many mentioned pilgrims present, but also a number of those old and faithful servants of the Cause-men who have done pioneer work in Persia and in neighbouring lands-men who have suffered for the faith in prisons and in exile, and who now are spending the evening of life serving in the shadow of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  In the late afternoon the friends assembled before the door of the Tomb.  'Abdu'l-Bahá was there.  All entered the outer chamber and stood facing the door of the inner chamber while he chanted two tablets.  All stood save one, for whom a chair had been placed, Áqá Siyyd Taghi, the aged Afnán who was assisted into the building, tenderly supported upon one side by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and upon the other by our good brother, Howard Struven.
Directly over the Tomb hangs a nine-branch candelabra and in this we were permitted to place lighted candles.  In the night Howard and I again climbed the mountain a second time.  The candles were still burning, and we had a quiet hour of prayer there together, remembering in our supplications the friends in the many assemblies and lands visited on our long journey, and thanking God for His wonderful bounties and blessings.
Talk No. 4 was given as 'Abdu'l-Bahá was giving us his parting blessing.  I assure you it was with joyful yet serious hearts that we left him to return to America.  He had filled our souls with his wonderful spirit of love and we were anxious to he away and serving as he directed.
Yours In His service,
Charles Mason Remey.

Talk No. 1-Haifa, 10 May 1910
Concerning the death of King Edward of England, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "The English king, with his pomp and grandeur, used to address the sun and say:  'Thou dost never disappear from my lands' ...; but now he is buried under the earth.  Some time ago the flags at the top of the masts proclaimed the day of his ascension to the throne; but today the flags are at half-mast, for he is dead.  The flags and banners of the Beloved are ever waving at the top of the masts; they are never inverted; nay, rather, they go on higher day by day; in fact, theirs is the sovereignty.  Without fighting forces they conquer the cities; and without and without taking any tribute they bestow and give freely.  The kings gain their victory through bloodshed and the taking of life; whereas the Beloved of God confer life and are victorious.  The sovereignty of the friends is an eternal one."
Concerning the trials and hardships, ordeals and oppressions which befell the beloved of God in Persia, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  'In America the people shall also thus serve you a little; they shall not permit you to escape and you cannot get rid of them."
We spoke about the inhabitants of Honolulu; that many nationalities are there represented and yet all are in great harmony.  'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "Time and place play a great influence over the conditions; when in a certain place some strangers meet, necessity requires that they should be in harmony; but our purpose is this, that the divine unity and concord may become well established among all the nations, so that they may become as one spirit in different bodies; the drops of one ocean; the fruits of one tree and the rays of the same sun.  In America, when the different people united together they were enabled to drive away the English government and establish a new government for themselves.  Consider how great is the result of unity and harmony!  There has never been any action performed nor any philanthropic deed achieved except through unity and concord; disagreement and dissension have always been the means of evil and corruption."
page 4
"Animals are of two kinds, one the grazing and domestic; the other the wild and ferocious.  If the wild beasts are near each other for ten years, still, as soon as they find an opportunity they attack and tear one another to pieces; whereas the tame creatures show their kind feelings toward each other. ...  The beloved of God are like the blessed birds; they are kind and merciful."
'Abdu'l-Bahá said a contribution had been sent from Persia for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Chicago and we should take the sum with us to the United States.  Mr Struven said that since contributions had come from the East to the West, we had felt ashamed of ourselves.  'Abdu'l-Bahá replied:  "You should never be ashamed; nay, rather, you must be very happy in realizing the power of the Word of God, which has enabled the beloved to send contributions from small villages of Persia."
"Some time ago, a few souls in America expressed their wish for a journey to Persia, but I told them to defer this undertaking for a while.  Now the time has come; they can go in these days, as there is no danger now."
"As you both have been together during this long tour, I hope that you shall be together also on your journey to Persia in the future."
Concerning the many Assemblies in America, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "These centres must have a complete connection and a firm union with each other, just as all the various Assemblies in Persia.  Rest assured, all this shall come to pass."
"Now is the commencement of the daybreak and the radiant morn is approaching.  Consider the trees yonder; as soon as they peep out of the earth they receive the bounty of the sun, the shower of mercy and the gift of breeze.  Although the same bounties are being bestowed upon them when they bring forth leaves, blossoms and fruit, still, there is a great difference between this state and that of the former one."
'Abdu'l-Bahá asked Mr Remey if he remembered the few Persian words he had learned, and then he said:  "The beloved of God are endowed with a particular language through which they express
page 5
their feelings and converse with one another.  The sun speaks to the existing beings, the cloud communicates with the earth and the gentle breeze whispers to the trees."
"The assistance and confirmations of God which shall attend you in the future will be so great and magnificent that when compared with those already experienced will make them seem very little."
'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "The two words, East and West, are imaginary words; there is no East and there is no West."
Talk No. 2-Haifa, 13 May 1910
'Abdu'l-Bahá spoke these words to a number of Jewish, Zoroastrian, Christian and Muslim Bahá'ís seated around his table and while serving them all.
"Among the human race, the bonds of and means for love are numerous, for man cannot live without it; nay, rather, human life is dependent upon friendship and affection.  Both the material and intrinsic development of man are conditional upon amity and love and the greatest honour and pleasure in the human world is love; but the ways and means are different.  Sometimes the cause of love is simply relationship and kinship; and sometimes it is a racial bond, patriotism, political affairs, etc.  But, through all these various bonds and means it is impossible to obtain a real and pure love; it is rather superficial and temporary.  Such love may easily be changed into enmity and rancour, for it is affected by the slightest manifestation of hostility; whereas a true and ideal love is faith and assurance.  Those who believe in God and are confident in His Word shall enter the Kingdom, and the essential oneness appears among them to such an extent that all become the drops of one ocean, the rays of one sun, the fishes of one sea, the trees of one garden, the birds of one orchard, the candles of one assembly and the stars of the same heaven.  Such love is real; there is no interruption for this connection, nor any separation for this union:  this foundation shall never
page 6
be destroyed, for it is eternal:  hence it is established that the love which exists among the beloved of God is everlasting, for it is a Divine bounty, a Godly appearance, a melody of the Kingdom and a heavenly cohesion.
"In the Qur'án it is said:  'They love Him and He loves them'-i.e., the bounty of love is one of the Divine bounties which comes to man from God; just as the sun when it sends its rays to the mirrors and thereby the mirrors are illumined; this effulgence and splendour are from the bounty of the sun.  Therefore, this love which is among the beloved is a Divine bounty, a Godly splendour, an eternal manifestation and the power of Divinity; it is perpetual.
"Praise be to God!  Ye are gathered here under the shadow of the Blessed Beauty and your hearts are overflowing with His love, your souls are rejoicing in His favours and 'Abdu'l-Bahá is serving you.  What more do you need?"
Talk No. 3-Haifa, 15 May 1910
Uttered by 'Abdu'l-Bahá on the day of the annual celebration of the Báb's Declaration, held on Mount Carmel, when representatives of all different religions, such as Jewish, Zoroastrian, Christian and Muslim Bahá'ís were seated around the table and 'Abdu'l-Bahá was serving them all personally:
"There are different gatherings and various meetings held in the world which apparently are in the utmost degree of arrangement and order; in the palaces of the kings many feasts and banquets are held which are incomparable and peerless; also, in the castles of the opulent ones great entertainments are presented and various kinds of foods and victuals are served; the singing of melodious tunes and playing of musical instruments exhilarate and deeply affect the concourse.  Associations for political affairs are formed and convivial banquets for pleasure and gratification are offered:  assemblages for exhibition of arts and sciences, literature and acquirements are established:  meetings for the promotion of industry and commercial matters are being
page 7
held; extraordinary conventions and religious congresses are arranged.  But all these assemblages and different gatherings are not to be compared with and equal to this, our meeting.  Although from those gatherings and conferences certain results and effects are produced which render great service to the human world and make mankind progress and develop on the plane of civilization, promulgate the attributes and virtues of the world of humanity; yet the results are limited, the fruits thereof are finite and the signs are bounded; whereas the traces, the lights and the results of this gathering are unlimited, boundless and infinite, for it is held on the Supreme Spot (the Tomb of the Báb) and under the shadow of the Blessed Beauty.
"This feast is one eternal!  It has connection with and relation to the soul and body; it shall be continued everlastingly.  At least an hundred thousand feasts shall follow this one.  All the other gatherings shall be forgotten, whereas the commemoration and celebration of this meeting shall remain and be duly observed forever throughout endless ages; it is under the merciful glances of the Blessed Beauty.
"Once His Holiness Christ gathered the disciples together, and having offered to them the Lord's Supper, He advised them, admonished them and uttered certain teachings to them, and then He said this was 'The Lord's Supper.' Now, as this meeting is held under the shadow of the Blessed Beauty, it should be called 'The Lord's Sustenance,' and as the consequences of 'The Lord's Supper' continued until the present time, so we hope that the results and effects of this 'Lord's Sustenance' may also become permanent and perpetual.  In fact, there is no meeting better than this, for it is held in the vicinity of the Supreme Spot and the faces are so brilliant and radiant!  What is there superior to this?"
Talk No. 4-Haifa, 18 May 1910
These words of 'Abdu'l-Bahá were addressed to Mr Charles Mason Remey and Mr Howard C. Struven on the day of their departure from his presence:
page 8
"In fact, you have shown forth a wonderful devotion; you left the West and came to the furthermost part of Asia.  On your journey you had to pass through hard experiences and difficulties; yet the confirmations of God enabled you to spread the Cause and to raise the summons of the Kingdom in all regions.  The Sun of Truth shall send forth its rays, the breeze of favour shall pass over and the rain of mercy shall be sent down upon the seeds which you have scattered and there shall be gathered and collected many harvests.  The results shall indeed be magnificent and glorious; some of them you shall soon witness with your own eyes.
"Now, when you go back to America you must circulate in detail all the incidents and news about your vast trip and inform them fully of the works achieved successfully throughout the different countries.
"Now you have to rest and repose for some time and let your strength and breath be renewed.  When a bird has been soaring in the air for a long time, it has to come down and rest for a while; after a long walk one must be seated and take some rest.
"I pray and supplicate at the Divine Threshold to confirm and aid you in all conditions, and that the seeds scattered may grow rapidly and form a charming plantation."
After giving instructions to some Persian pilgrims who were leaving on the same day, 'Abdu'l-Bahá arose and embraced them all one by one.  Some were crying, the tears rolling down their cheeks.
"Good-by!" he said to all.

Around the world with Messrs Remey and Struven
The Bahai News devotes this issue to notes taken and letters [only the Tablet extracts have been included here] written by Mr Charles Mason Remey and Mr Howard C. Struven during their recent journey around the world in the interests of the Cause.  The following extracts from Tablets
page 13
revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá show the importance and world-wide effect of this tour:
Truly, I say, this beloved of 'Abdu'l-Bahá left his native land, turned his back upon the comforts and pleasures of home, accepted the difficulties of travels, and crossed the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans.  In the Hawaiian Islands he gave the Glad-tidings of the Kingdom; in Japan he delivered the Teachings of His Highness the Incomparable.  He summoned the souls to the Most Great Guidance, and suffered the thirsty ones to drink from the Fountain of Job.  He proclaimed the Dawn of the Manifest Light in China, and he perfumed India with the Fragrance of the Rose-garden of the Merciful.  Praise be to God, he became assisted, confirmed, and raised the Summons of the Kingdom in those countries, suffered the Mysteries of the Realm of Might to become manifest, built a structure which will remain firm and established forever and ever, enkindled a lamp whose illumination will be perpetual, and planted a tree whose fruits will be limitless.
Consider thou how the power of the Word of God has united the East and the West and bestowed spiritual communication, that a blessed soul from the inhabitants of America, while in the Holy Land, mentioned to 'Abdu'l-Bahá the name of a man living in Asia, and with the utmost devotion requests the writing of a Tablet.  Praise be to God!  What a communication!  What a unity and concord!  Today the inhabitants of the world must be engaged generally in praising the Word of God, which has bestowed such a bounty and has established such a harmony and affiliation that the Beloved of the union of the race of man has uncovered the face, displaying the utmost beauty and perfection in the assemblages of the world, and is captivating the hearts of everyone in all the regions.

Letter from Mr Remey
[Part of the letter from Mr Remey]
Dear Friends in Abhá,
Since my arrival in this country, from the Holy Land, on 3 June, I have received many inquiries from the friends regarding any possible instructions which 'Abdu'l-Bahá might have sent through Mr Struven and me to the friends in America to be followed in the Bahá'í work.  We are the bearers of no instructions whatever; nevertheless, we, as all who come from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, have a message or a lesson to share with all.
The one great lesson which we learned while with 'Abdu'l-Bahá was the lesson of the Unity of the believers-the interdependence of the believers in each of the assemblies, and the interdependence of these assemblies between one another, both East and West.
On our long journey to 'Akká many of the friends asked us to place before 'Abdu'l-Bahá certain ques-
page14
tions pertaining to the work of the Holy Cause.  In practically every case his reply was that the friends should consult together and that that which they agreed upon in all joy and fragrance would be pleasing and acceptable to him, and that whatever should be thus decided after consultation and deliberation is the course to be pursued in carrying on the work of the Holy Cause.
In telling 'Abdu'l-Bahá of the work in the various cities in which the friends were united in consultation and works, he was greatly pleased and showed evident satisfaction.  In practically every conversation which we had with 'Abdu'l-Bahá he gave us a lesson upon consultation and working together-sometimes told in one way and sometimes told in another.
During our travels of last summer Mr Struven and I found that some of the friends interpreted the instructions of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to mean that the time has not vet arrived for meetings of consultation in the various assemblies, nor for system in carrying on the work (that is to say, organization).
While with 'Abdu'l-Bahá we learned that he had told others (as well as ourselves) that now is not the time for establishing The House of Justice according to The Book of Aqdas.  However, from his many talks he left no doubt in our minds that he wished the believers to unite, consult, organize and work together.
Personally I can see that united effort in the Bahá'í work is the crying need of this day.  The real work is now not being carried on by separate individuals but by those who are casting aside individualism and are adhering to the principles of Unity in thought, spirit and action.  This is the principle of the spiritual growth and strength of the Holy Cause which 'Abdu'l-Bahá made so very clear to us.
It is almost needless to mention that Mr Struven and I, in our round of visits, noticed that in those centres where the friends were united in consultation and in harmonious work and service, that there the Cause was manifestly strong and vigorous, while in those centres where the friends were not working along systematic lines the fruits of the work were not so evident.
Some copies of the Bahai News were reaching the Orient while we were there.  Everywhere the friends were pleased with this effort.  During our travels Mr Struven and I felt much the need of such an organ which would strengthen the ties of Unity between the East and the West.
About three years ago 'Abdu'l-Bahá told me to publish, semi-annually, a bulletin in both Persian and English, at the same time instructing that the matter to be published should first be sent to him to be approved.  Accordingly, the manuscript for the first issue was sent to him, and after an interval of three or four months the matter for the second issue was also forwarded.  Nothing was ever heard from either package.  There was much correspondence from my end of the line, but all to no avail for there were no traces to follow up.
page 15
I know that 'Abdu'l-Bahá is still anxious to have an Occidental-Oriental publication to further the holy work.  I feel that the Bahai News is a most important step toward this other work, and at the same time is accomplishing a long needed work among the English speaking assemblies. ...
Faithfully yours in His Cause,
Charles Mason Remey.

Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Fourteen years ago the following words were revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in a Tablet to the Persian believers:
The Divine confirmations have in every way prepared for you the means of development.  Before long your brethren will come to Persia from Europe and America.  They will organize new industries; found the traces of civilization, various factories, the spread of commerce, increase of agriculture, and the universalization of learning.  As soon as security and tranquillity are reached to the limit of perfection by the endeavours of the government, they will come, and will make the territory of Persia the envy of the world and of the other provinces.  At that time the government will become exceedingly pleased, and the wishes of this Servant in wishing good for the Empire and my sincerity to the Imperial Throne, will become manifest.

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Through Mr Howard Struven, to the Spiritual Assembly of Baltimore, Maryland:
HE IS GOD!
O ye Merciful Assembly!
Mr Struven became the herald of the Kingdom and travelled through the countries of China, India and Japan.  The Supreme Confirmations bestowed assistance, so that he attained to this heavenly Bounty.  He became the cause of the glory of the believers of Baltimore and imparted happiness and joy to the friends and maid-servants of the Merciful.  He sacrificed everything in the Path of the Kingdom and imparted life to many souls.  The results of this trip, ere long, will become apparent and manifest like unto the sun and moon, and the Most Great Confirmation be unveiled.
O ye friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful, hearken to the counsels of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  The world of matter is not worthy of consideration or indulgence therein.  Soon the life of everything will come to an end, therefore you must endeavour to raise the banner of greatness in the uni-coloured universe of God, attract the splendours of the Sun of Truth, become the cause of the illumination of the realm of man, serve all humanity, spread the essential oneness, become the embodiment of Divine Mercy, the impersonation of the Gift of His Highness the Almighty, seek eternal life, and discover the majesty of the age-abiding sovereignty.
Ponder and reflect a moment, millions of kings have stepped forth from the invisible world into
page 2
the arena of appearance, and all of them have vanished and disappeared.  But a servant of the servants of the True One, who finds eternal life through the Breaths of the Holy Spirit, establishes everlasting dominion in the Kingdom of God; even in this temporal world his signs are spread and are known, his name becomes famous and his light diffused in every region.
Upon ye be the Glory of God!

Interview with 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Extract from a letter written by a Mrs Crockett, May, 1910, to Miss Frances Johnson, Pearl City, Hawaii:
I must tell you a little about Palestine and about one experience in particular.  A visit to Palestine does certainly make the Bible seem like a new book and brings home to one's heart the reality of Christ's life and teachings.
I felt this particularly at Nazareth, the home of His boyhood, and at the Sea of Galilee, which is so associated with His ministry.  We had a lovely early morning row on the peaceful lake, and the memories of Christ that came to us seemed to make His presence very real.
Now, I know you will be eager to hear of my interview with the one in Palestine whose teachings mean so much to you, the Prophet, or 'Abbás Effendi,8 as he is generally called.
I found that he is not now kept a prisoner at 'Akká, but since the order of constitutional government in Turkey he is free to live in his home at Haifa (near by) and go and come as he will.
I planned my trip so that I could stop and see him, for I remember when you gave me some of the literature to read you said:  "If you go to Egypt, Palestine is not far away and you will surely want to see him." So I planned for the interview with him when the others of the party went to 'Akká for a drive.  (Perhaps you know that Haifa is a pretty little town right at the foot of Mt Carmel.)
Well, I sent word to him of my wish to see him and he replied that he would see me in the afternoon, as his time was taken up that morning in seeing some people from India.  So I went to his house at the time appointed and was shown into the presence of an old man, clothed in the flowing robe of a Persian, with white hair and a long white beard, with eyes that seemed to look me through and yet were most friendly, too.  It was the Prophet!  He received me most graciously, and his interpreter, a young Syrian, a student at the American Missionary College at Beirut.
page 6
I told him first about the little circle of his friends in far off Honolulu-you who meet together to discuss his teachings-and I told him of your love and loyalty.  He seemed very happy at this and his face lighted up as he asked for the names of those who knew and loved him. ...  He sent you all his love and blessing and said he would pray for each one of you, and he added:  "Tell them that they have a great mission-to make the blind eyes see, to make the deaf ears hear and to shed the light of knowledge where the darkness of ignorance prevails." That was his message to you.  He talked with me for some time, first telling me of his country, Persia, of his life and then of his teachings.
As he talked with me I felt my heart soften under the influence of his goodness and kindness, and the tears came to my eyes.  He asked me about myself, if I were well and if I were happy.  I replied to the latter question:  "I have had many sorrows." "Forget them!" he answered.  "When your heart is filled with the love of God there will be no room for sorrow.  There will only be love and happiness." I cannot tell you the sweet sympathy of his voice as he said these beautiful and comforting words.
Then he had the attendant bring in tea, a cup for him and a cup for me.  We drank together, wishing each other health and happiness, and then he told me that he hoped he should take tea with me in the Kingdom of Heaven!
When I praised the tea he said it was real Persian tea and presented me with a package to take away with me.  (I wish I could send you some of it.  I am afraid it would lose its strength though before it reached you.)
When I finally said good-by he put his hand on my head and blessed me and wished that I might be a blessing. ...  I went away feeling softened, uplifted and blessed.  I am so glad you told me of him and urged me to see him.  He wrote his name in my book for me and told me always to remember it.
I tell you all these little incidents as I know they will interest you.

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár
A recent pilgrim to 'Akká wrote to the Financial Secretary that when she was in Haifa last winter she asked 'Abdu'l-Bahá if it was not of great importance to help in the sending of spiritual people to Syria to be taught by him, and he replied:  "It is now of utmost importance for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár to be built."  Corinne True.

... the following extract from a Tablet to a believer in Persia, should receive the careful perusal of the men who are interested in the progress of the Cause in the Occident:
You have written regarding the Assembly of Women.  Undoubtedly, show ye great effort in this matter, and
page 11
make constant endeavour in the expansion of its spheres, and know ye of a certainty that it will be crowned with great success.  This subject is pregnant with far-reaching results and when it is directed in a benefiting manner, such women will be trained In that Assembly that the whole world will be astonished by their eloquent speeches and fluent utterances, and they will silence and discomfort the orators of the East and the West.  Today the women in the West lead the men in the service of the Cause, summon the people under the shade of the Blessed Perfection, and loosen their tongues in eloquent lectures, delivery of wonderful proofs and the elucidation of new arguments.

Funeral readings and prayer
[A letter reported the death of an infant child and the burial service.  Included were the following unsourced readings.]
To consider that after the death of the body the spirit perishes, is like imagining that a bird in a cage will be destroyed if the cage is broken-though the bird has nothing to fear from the destruction of the cage.  Our body is like the cage, and the spirit is like the bird.  We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of sleep:  therefore, if the cage becomes broken, the bird will continue to exist:  its feelings will be even more powerful, its perceptions greater and its happiness increased.  In truth, from hell it reaches a paradise of delights, because for the thankful bird there is no paradise greater than freedom from the cage.
Infants are under the shadow of the favour of God, and as they have not committed any sin and are not soiled with the impurities of the world of nature, they
page 13
are centres of the manifestation of bounty, and the Eye of Compassion will be turned upon them.
In the Name of God, the Supreme, the High!  I ask Thee, by the sorrow of the hearts of the beloved and by the tears of the eyes of the lovers, to deprive me not from the fragrances of Thy Godliness in Thy Days, and from the melodies of the Dove of Thy Oneness at the appearance of the Lights of Thy Face!
Hold Thou my right arm, O God! and dwell continually with me!  Guide me to the fountain of Thy Knowledge and encircle me with Thy Glory.  Let mine ears hearken unto Thy melodious tone and comfort me with Thy Presence.  For Thou art the strength of my heart, and the trust of my soul, and 1 desire no one beside Thee!

Words of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to friends in America
Extracts from Tablets recently received by the Librarian of the Spiritual Assembly (H. of S.) of Chicago, for preservation in archives, and sent to the Bahai News for publication.
HE IS GOD!
O thou son of the Kingdom!
... Today, the most important affair and greatest hope is the unity and concord of the Friends.  In every city where the Friends are united, spirituality and illumination is manifest and apparent with infinite power and strength; but where there is a lack of the warmth of love, every one becomes withered, cold, unhappy and deprived.  Therefore, endeavour ye with all your heart and soul so that union and concord may be increased, the Word of God promoted and the lights of unity be spread.  Convey on behalf of 'Abdu'l-Bahá the wonderful Abhá Greeting to all the Friends of that Spiritual Assembly.
Translated by Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb, 16 August 1910.
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!
... Ere long the regions of the West will become the dawning-places of the East, and the Sun of Truth will shine in such wise that the darkness of ignorance will be dispelled.  But a large multitude of people will arise against you, showing oppression, expressing contumely and derision, shunning your society, and heaping upon you ridicule.  However, the Heavenly Father will illumine you to such an extent that, like unto the rays of the sun, you shall scatter the dark clouds of superstition, shine gloriously in the midst of Heaven and illumine the face of the earth.  You must make firm the feet at the time when these trials transpire, and demonstrate forbearance and patience.  You
page 2
must withstand them with the utmost love and kindness; consider their oppression and persecution as the caprice of children, and do not give any importance to whatever they do.  For at the end the illumination of the Kingdom will overwhelm the darkness of the world and the exaltation and grandeur of your station will become apparent and manifest; nothing will remain hidden.  If the light remain in the depth of the well, ere long its shining will appear on the summit of the hill.  The small ones will become great, the powerless powerful, the babes will become the children of the Kingdom, and the wanderers reach the Divine native land of the Father.  Rest ye assured.

We take the liberty of prefacing the letters selected for this issue with the following Tablet to one of the friends at Cincinnati, Ohio, believing it not only confirms the correctness of the observations of our brothers that organization and systematic work is needed in many centres, but that it will assist such centres in their endeavour to comply with the wish of 'Abdu'l-Bahá expressed therein:
Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
HE IS GOD!
O thou seeker of the Kingdom!
Thy letter was received.  It is impossible to organize the House of Justice in these days; it will be formed after the establishment of the Cause of God.  Now, the Spiritual Assemblies are organized in most of the cities, you must also organize a Spiritual Assembly in Cincinnati.  It is permissible to elect the members of the Spiritual Assembly from among the men and women; nay, rather, it is better, so that perfect union may result.  According to the Texts of the Aqdas the dues are to be collected in the Treasury in order to meet the necessary demands, but do not make the dues obligatory to anyone.  Everyone can pay according to the dictates of their hearts and let it be a voluntary contribution.
O thou seeker of the Kingdom!  Now is the time that you may become engaged in that country in the promotion of the Word of God, the diffusion of the sweet fragrances of the Paradise of Abhá and the spreading of the Divine Teachings.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!

Prayer from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Excerpt from a long prayer revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá at the marriage feast of Mírzá Eskander Khán (Mr Sydney Sprague) and Farahangise Khánum, daughter of the well-known Bahá'í teacher, Mírzá Asadu'lláh, who were recently married by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, himself, in the presence of representatives of all nations and religions at Haifa, Syria:
Lord!  Verily, Thy servant, Eskander Sprague, journeyed to the most remote countries while aglow with Thy Love; he was attracted by Thy Call while in those far-away regions, hastened to the Radiant Spot (the Holy Land) and willed to unite with Thy pure maidservant who believeth In Thy Verses, who is aflame with the Fire of Thy Love and who is related9 to The Branch of the Tree of Thy Grace.  Lord!  Make this marriage blessed by Thy Favour; happy by the benediction of Thy Generosity; an indissoluble tie; a partnership holy unto Sprague; a blending fellowship, a rejoicing, a unity and an affinity lasting throughout the Eternity of Eternities, in every world of Thy Holy Worlds-upon the plane of the Spirits and the Lights.  Verily, Thou art the Helper!  Verily, Thou are the Generous!  Verily, Thou art the Merciful, the Clement!

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
To the Beloved of God in Tihrán, Persia.
HE IS GOD!
O ye Beloved Friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!
Today the most important affair is delivering the Cause of God and spreading the fragrances of God.  The duty of every soul among the believers of God is that he must rest neither day nor night, and with every breath think of the diffusion of the fragrances of Truth.  That is, he must endeavour as far as lies in his power to quicken and guide a soul to the Path of Immortality, for this service of his will be perpetuated throughout centuries and cycles.
The power of the faith of the first guide will be transmitted, find continuation and become manifest in the lives of other believers, until one sanctified soul will become the cause of quickening a hundred thousand souls.  Consider how important this is, for the guidance of one soul is greater than the sovereignty of a kingdom.  The temporal dominion is ended in a few days and no effect or result, no rejoicing or happiness, no beatitude or praise and no name or fame is produced thereby.  But this sovereignty which consists in the guidance of the souls is eternal and everlasting.  It embraces the Divine Beloved and it establishes man upon the throne of grandeur.  Therefore, Spiritual Assemblies must be established in all the cities and their aims must be the guidance of the souls.
Likewise some teachers must be sent to various parts and in every direction, for the sake of diffusing the fragrances of God, so that they may direct the seekers to the Divine Path; even the coming and going of the friends is beneficial.  For instance, the friends who live in the smaller cities often do not receive any news, and then only at random.  Now if certain souls arise to travel through these places, give the Glad-tidings of God, stay in every
page 2
place a night or two, deliver the news of the Holy Land and other countries and cities of the East and West, and associate with them with the utmost love, enthusiasm and happiness, this will be conducive to attraction and enkindlement, the people will be trained in spiritual matters and obtain exhilaration and life.  This will become the cause of diffusing the fragrances and the motive-power of the promulgation of the Word of God.
His Honour, Mírzá Áqá Taráz, and 'Alí Akbar are two blessed souls, and they are the cause of happiness to the heart of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  It as assured that they will become assisted in the universal services, and in the Kingdom of Abhá they will shine and gleam like unto the morning star.
Upon ye be the Glory of God!

Words of 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Some of the words uttered by 'Abdu'l-Bahá to Messrs Howard C. Struven and Charles Mason Remey while in his presence at Haifa, Syria, May, 1910.
"Welcome!  You are blessed in making such a world pilgrimage and by being allowed to serve in so many countries.  Many Tourists travel around the globe visiting places and cities, but their tours have no lasting effect and are soon forgotten.  The effect of your tour will be eternal.  Its effect will be seen during the ensuing centuries."
page 6
...
In speaking of spreading the fragrances of the Kingdom, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "In movement there is life; in immobility there is death.  The travelling of the teachers from place to place, country to country, and from the Occident to the Orient, is one of the greatest means for sowing spiritual seeds in the souls of the people."
In speaking again of Japan, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "Blessed results will appear from the Holy Cause established in that land.  I have sent your letter regarding the work in Japan to Mr MacNutt10 in
page 7
New York, that he may spread the word for some of the American believers to go to Japan, and there serve and teach in the Cause.  It is very good for teachers to travel, and, through the love of God, give life to the people.  American Bahá'ís should go to the Oriental countries as teachers."
At another time 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:  "Encourage the Bahá'ís to hasten to India, both men and women teachers.  In India, in particular, women teachers are needed.  Delay not!  Now is the time to travel there, and in Persia, too."
"Later on, the results of your journey will be clearly seen.  Praise be to God!-now our meeting here in the Land of Desire (the Holy Land) i.e. open and easy, while in the past it would have been most difficult.  Some of the friends came long distances and could only see me from a distance.  Now you must go out and serve-you must no longer stay here."

Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Bahá
To his honour, Mr MacNutt-Upon him be Bahá'u'l-Abhá.
HE IS GOD!
O thou herald of the True One!
His honour, Mr Remey, is travelling in India and has created wonderful interest among the people.  Truly I say, in these days, India is awakened to a greater receptive capacity.  The letter of Mr Remey is enclosed.  Consider how India has attained to receptivity.  If several teachers from America travel to those parts it is certain that the Lights of the Kingdom shall illumine that region and many souls will be raised from among the Hindus and become the Army of Light through the power of the Word of God and the outpouring of the cloud of the Love of God, they will make India a rose garden.  Encourage and urge a few souls to take a trip to India so that they may fully realize that the doors of the Kingdom are opened, behold the uninterrupted confirmations of His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh, and unfurl a banner waving forever and ever with the breezes of Divine Confirmation and Assistance.  Give this matter your most earnest consideration, for it is the most important problem of all problems concerning the Cause.  We have also written to Persia to send a teacher to that country, but if several souls go from America it will have greater influence and weight and far-reaching results will become apparent and manifest.
Upon thee be the Glory of the Most Glorious!

Around the world with Messrs Remey and Struven
[Extracts from a fifth in a series of letters.]
Written shortly after the interviews with 'Abdu'l-Bahá, from notes taken at the time, by Charles Mason Remey, while in Haifa, Syria, May, 1910.
Question-Many of the American believers desire to worship daily in accordance with the Teachings.  What prayers should they use daily?  No instruction has yet been revealed for them regarding daily worship.
Answer-Later on I will give instructions.
Question-Was Bahá'u'lláh of the seed of Jesse?
Answer-Yes.  He was the ninth generation in succession from Jesse, but this was not the Jesse of the Bible.
Question-What is the Command regarding the giving of tithes:  Is it 19% of the increase of one's capital, or is it the one-nineteenth part of one's income?
Answer-It should be the one-nineteenth part of one's income.  This tithe giving is a blessed privilege.  Among mankind money is the greatest thing.  This giving will confirm the people.  With this money many great works will be done.  In Hamadan in Persia, the Jewish believers raised much money in this way.  At first I did not accept this money, but later on I directed that it should be used in their own town for the Bahá'í school.  This giving was a great spiritual blessing to those believers.  Everyone knows how the Jews love money.
Question-Is the calendar as revealed by the Báb to be used in this Dispensation?
Answer-Yes; but later on modifications will be made.
Question-From what year does the era of the New Dispensation date-from the Declaration of the Báb or from that of Bahá'u'lláh?
Answer-From the Declaration of the Báb, AH 1260 or AD 1844.
Question-Which day of the week will the Bahá'ís eventually observe as a day of rest?
Answer-Friday.
Question-We have been taught that Bahá'u'lláh Was the Seventh of a series of great World (Universal) Manifestations of this present cycle, Christ being the sixth, Melchesidec the fifth, while the first four
page 3
were before the compilation of our present world history, and of them we have no records; that their teachings were applicable to all mankind under all conditions; while upon the other hand the Manifestations, such as Zoroaster, Abraham, Moses, Muhammad and the Báb were sent each to a certain, people, bringing teachings which were applicable to those certain conditions and people only, while the teachings of the World Manifestations were not limited in their application to peoples.  Is this teaching correct?
Answer-Yes, it is correct.
In a subsequent conversation, during which questions were being asked and answered, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said:
That Bahá'u'lláh was not a descendant from the Prophet Zoroaster.
That the Anniversary of the martyrdom of the Báb should be observed with solemnity by the friends.
That the Anniversary of the Departure of Bahá'u'lláh should be observed in like manner, and that in the night time a meeting of prayer should be held.
That it would be well for the Western friends to interest themselves in commercial and industrial matters with the people of Persia, for Persia and the West both need connection one with the other.
That in serving together the believers should always avoid those matters upon which they cannot agree.  The believers should serve together, the men and women working together in harmony.  In meetings of consultation the majority should rule, but it is far preferable that there should be such unity that there be no minority-that all should be of one mind.

'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt
First of a series of special news items pertaining to the tour of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  Portion of a letter from Mr Sydney Sprague to Mrs Isabella D. Brittingham.
Mount Carmel, 29 August 1910.
Dear Sister in the Holy Cause:  I have a very big piece of news to tell you.  'Abdu'l-Bahá has left this Holy Spot for the first time in forty-two years, and has gone to Egypt.  Think of the vast significance and importance of this step!  By it many prophecies of the sacred Scriptures are fulfilled.  The Light and Life of 'Akká has departed and we feel as though we were now left in obscurity while Egypt is illumined, and that ancient country which has seen the prophets Joseph and Moses and even the infant Christ is now to see the Consummation of all the prophets.  Will it appreciate and realize this Bounty?  Everyone was astounded to hear of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's departure, for no one knew until the very last minute that he had any idea of leaving.  The afternoon of the day he left, he came to Mírzá Asadu'lláh's home to see us and sat with us awhile beside a new well that has just been finished and said that he had come to taste the water.  We did not realize that it was a good-bye visit.  Then he took a carriage and went up the hill to the Holy Tomb (of the Báb).  That night, as usual, the believers gathered before the house of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to receive that blessing, which every day is ours, of being in his presence, but we waited in vain, for one of the sons in law came and told us that 'Abdu'l-Bahá had taken the Khedivial steamer for Port Said.  We could hardly believe it was true, so great was this news.  Think how happy we must be that after forty-two years in this cage, the Divine Bird has spread His wings and in perfect freedom flown away.
__________
SPECIAL:  Word has been received from Port Said that 'Abdu'l-Bahá has sailed from that port on a steamer for an unknown destination.

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
To the Believers in Systan, Persia.
Upon them be the Glory of God the Most Glorious.
HE IS GOD!
O ye believers of God and friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!
If ye knew how the heart of 'Abdu'l-Bahá is soaring at this moment at your mentioning and the spirit is rejoicing at your name, undoubtedly you would not contain yourselves in this physical temple, neither would you have heeded any persecution or suffering.
Today the world of existence is moved through the Call of the Covenant, and the disjoined members of this earth have found mutual communication.  Consider ye that the confusion produced thereby cannot be cleared and the forces cannot be brought together save through the Power of the Testament, and the darkness of the East and the West can only be dispelled through the Sun of the Covenant.  The Divine Covenant is like unto the spiritual Springtime, which encircles all creation.
Now the greatest test for a tree is to have the latent possibility of fruition, and with the appearance of the spring they put forth leaves, branches and blossoms, but if a tree is barren at this season it will remain deprived and fruitless.  Likewise, those souls who have been firm in the Covenant of God, are detached from all else save God, and are attracted to the fragrances of God, their faces will shine like unto the luminous moon, with the Light of Assurance.  But the jealous bats, the people of injustice and pride, flew away from the Light of the Covenant and shrank out of sight into the dark dungeon of hesitation and fear.  They have left the lamp of the Testament and are running in the Sahara of discord and are seeking the gloom of worldliness.  They turned away from the Pure Spring of Life and attached themselves to the stagnant pools of superstition.  They left behind the Paradise of Abhá and were contented with this nether world.
page 2
They do not search after the Garden of Holiness but they wish for the sterile desert of passions and selfishness.  They passed by the Blessed Tree and gathered around the stunted bitter plant.  They did not yearn for the Star of Guidance, but they desired the will-o'-the-wisp of allurements.  This is the result of their exertion in this life.  Leave them to themselves, pay no heed to their faults, for verily they have left the Path of Guidance and forgotten the Road to Righteousness.  Verily, they are afflicted with disharmony and discord and their loss will be very great.
Therefore, O ye friends of God! enter ye in the Rose-garden of Oneness, take ye a share from the essence of singleness and spread the Breaths of the Morn of Holiness.  The Glad-tidings of the Bounty of the Blessed Perfection is descending from the Invisible Kingdom, the Sea of Providence is moving and the waves of the Mercy of the Almighty are unlimited.  Endeavour ye as far as ye can, so that ye may immerse yourselves in this vast Ocean and soar heavenward towards this Exalted Apex.
The greatest of all affairs is unity and harmony, the love and affection of heart and soul.  The believers of God are the waves of one Sea, the drops of one River, the signs of one Kingdom, the standards of one Regiment the lights of one Orb, the Armies of one General, the stars of one Heaven and are addressed by one Covenant.  Consequently they must associate with each other like the brilliant Stars of Pleiades in one firmament and become the letters and words of one Book.
Upon ye be greeting and praise!

"O God, my aim, my hope!  With hearts full of longing and breasts full of yearning, we beg of Thee and we supplicate at the threshold of Thy Might to raise the foundation of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in Chicago in the most speedy manner.  Make its basis firm and its structure enduring, suffer its pillars to remain unshakeable and make its columns of the steel and iron of firmness.  Glorify its servants, beautify the characters and make the worshipers beloved.  Suffer its nightingales to sing, 'Yá Bahá'u'l-Abhá!' and its parrots to warble the praises of our Lord, the Most Supreme.  Make its men the standards unfolded on the mountains of the world, and its women the sanctified angels of the tabernacle of the world!"

Your letter which was written on the Day of Naw-Rúz in the assembly of the friends, has arrived.  Its contents told of spiritual happenings and feelings of attraction.  Its reading brought me the utmost happiness, for-Praise be to God!-in Germany, the servants and the maid-servants of the Rahman have adorned a gathering of friendship and love in the Day of Naw-Rúz, have perfumed their nostrils with the vivifying breezes of the divine garden, and have been mentioning the King of the Kingdom and the Lord of Hosts.
Therefore, 'Abdu'l-Bahá has been praying and supplicating to the Word of God that these servants and maid-servants of the Rahmán may day by day become more brilliant and make greater progress, penetrate the mysteries of the Kingdom, become the cause of the diffusing of the principles of human unity, call every one to the Shade of the Tent of harmony and instruction of mankind, become the cause of enlightenment of these regions, make the hearts filled with the love of the bountiful Beloved, and attract the people to the divine Kingdom, so that during the coming year they may make still greater progress.

O ye illumined Friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá!
Praise be to God, that you have organized and established a new assembly in the land of Isfahán and with the utmost devotion its members are arising to serve the Blessed Perfection (Bahá'u'lláh).  I was pleased to know, also, that you have organized a committee for correspondence with all parts of the world, and another committee to teach the Truth to the youths.  Wonderful confirmation and complete assistance is destined for all the members of these various committees.  This move is identical with blessing and this glorious intention is accepted in the Threshold of Oneness.  It is my hope that you may perform these services in a befitting manner; that you may become the dawning-places of the Bounties of the Infinite; centres of merciful feelings and the manifestors of the rays of the Everlasting Glory.
I trust that you may make the land of Isfahán a salubrious fountain, so that the cool water of knowledge and the flowing river of assurance may make that region the envy of the green garden of Paradise.  That city was illumined with the presence of His Highness, the Báb, after he left Shíráz; the Word of God was promulgated; many blessed souls became believers; a number of them hastened toward the arena of martyrdom; his highness, the leader of the righteous ones, the "King of the Martyrs," and the master of the friends, the "Beloved of Martyrs," gave up their lives at the altar of love.  His Highness, Ashraf, and many other martyrs drank the cup of trials and sacrificed their lives with the utmost severance.  Therefore, it is the hope of 'Abdu'l-Bahá that that region may become the Green Garden and that city the delectable Paradise.
Upon ye he the Glory of God!

'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt
[Second of a series of special news items pertaining to the sojourn of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt.]
"OUT OF EGYPT HAVE I CALLED MY SON."
To those who are familiar with the sacred prophecies and the history of the Bahá'í (Glorious) Revelation, 'Abdu'l-Bahá's "going down into Egypt", after forty years' confinement in the Holy Land-in the prison town of 'Akká, near the foot of Mt. Carmel-is an event fraught with wonderful and tremendous significance; for it is, undoubtedly, that event whereby the Word of God, as uttered by the Prophet Hosea (11:1) finds its complete fulfilment-although foreshadowed in the sojourn of the infant Jesus in that land nearly two thousand years ago (St. Matt. 2:25).
It is an event that has stirred the Bahá'ís everywhere, for when it became known that 'Abdu'l-Bahá had departed for that ancient country of Joseph, there swept over the Bahá'í world a mighty spirit of activity.  It is an event that will, doubtless, soon command the serious attention of the Jewish and Christian worlds (especially those who await the coming of the Son "in the glory of his Father" as it has already commanded the attention of the Muslim world; for, at present, the Egyptian newspapers the most influential in the Muslim world today-are divided into two camps:  some praising 'Abdu'l-Bahá's work; others trying to stop the floodgate of his irresistible influence.
Moamid, a paper respected by all the Islamic world, says:  "Although he ('Abdu'l-Bahá) has lived the greater part of his life in 'Akká, Syria, yet there are millions of people-in Persia, India, Europe and America-who follow him and respect him to the point of worship and adoration.  Whosoever associates with him, finds him a man who has information upon all subjects of human interest; his words are eloquent and attract the hearts, and enkindle the souls.  His teachings and conversation revolve around the centre of the greatest of the world's problems:  To remove entirely, religious, racial and patriotic prejudices, and lay the foundation of a brotherhood and unity that will last throughout the ages and eternity."
Such is the statement of the leading newspaper printed in Arabic, while the editor of an influential
page 3
Persian newspaper printed in Cairo writes in a personal letter that he was summoned by 'Abdu'l-Bahá to his presence, and although a few weeks before, he wrote and published an article against the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh, he accepted the invitation and left Cairo for Alexandria.  He met 'Abdu'l-Bahá and became a changed man.  He went a stranger and an avowed antagonist; he returned a friend, and will write an article in favour of the Cause.  He writes:  "Indeed, I was very much benefited in meeting 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  The Arabic newspapers are now anxiously waiting to read my comment upon the matter.  You shall read my paper No. 20 and believe you will prize it very highly.  There is no doubt that some people will slander and accuse me of being bought, but I do not care.  I have seen the Truth, and I will write the truth, no matter what may happen."
Many others, who have been the enemies of the Cause, have gone, either through curiosity or honest investigation, to visit 'Abdu'l-Bahá-the Servant of God and man-and have returned with the Glory of Truth in their faces.
What is the key to this irresistible spiritual power that thus opens the locked doors of the hearts of men?  Those who are familiar with his Teachings, answer that it is his practice of them.  He says:  "Be ye kind to the human world and be ye compassionate to the race of man.  Deal with the stranger as you deal with the friends.  Be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you are toward the beloved owes.  Know ye the enemy are the friend.  Look upon the satan as upon the angel and receive the unjust with the utmost love like unto a faithful one."
Truly, as of old, great miracles are transpiring on the banks of the river Nile, in the ancient land of the Pharaohs!

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in America
"When the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár was erected in 'Ishqábád, its influence was felt in all the Oriental countries.  Whosoever heard of it, commenced an investigation of the Cause.  Now, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of 'Ishqábád, like an evident banner, waves in the world.  And if in Chicago the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár is established, even as in 'Ishqábád, then you will see what the recognition of the Cause will do; particularly the arrangement of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár is such that it will exert the greatest effect upon the civilized world, for it has many accessories.  Among them are the following:  A school for orphans; a college for higher scientific education (or higher knowledge) ; a hospital; a home for cripples; a hospice.  When the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, with its accessories, be established in the world, aside from its religious or spiritual influence, it will have a tremendous effect upon civilization.  Aside from the religionists who will feel its influence, materialists will not be exempt therefrom.  Moreover, it contains Divine wisdoms, spiritual effects upon the intellects and thoughts.  Subsequent to its erection these will become evident."

... You have asked for an account of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's departure to the land of Egypt.  'Abdu'l-Bahá did not inform anyone that he was going to leave Haifa.  The day he left he visited the Holy Tomb of the Báb on Mt Carmel, and when he came down from the mountain of the Lord, he went direct to the steamer.  This was the first anyone knew about the matter.  Within two days he summoned to his presence, Mírzá Núri'd-Dín-i-Zayn, Shoghi Effendi, Khusraw, and this servant.  The only persons who accompanied 'Abdu'l-Bahá to Egypt were Mírzá Munír Zayn and 'Abdu'l-Husayn, one of the pilgrims who was leaving at that time.  When Mírzá Núri'd-Dín-i-Zayn arrived in Port Said, his brother Mírzá Munír returned to Haifa.
For nearly one month 'Abdu'l-Bahá remained in Port Said and the friends of God came from Cairo, in turn, to visit him.  One day he called me to accompany him when taking a walk in the streets of the city.  He said:  "Do you realize now the meaning of my statement when I was telling the friends that there was a wisdom in my indisposition?"  I answered, "Yes, I do remember very well."  He continued, "Well, the wisdom was that I must always move according to the requirements of the Cause.  Whatever the Cause requires for its promulgation, I will not delay in its accomplishment for one moment!  Now, the Cause did require that I travel to these parts, and had I divulged my intention at that time, many difficulties would have arisen."
The day that he left for Alexandria he did not mention the matter to anyone; nor did this servant know the time of his departure.  However, when I heard that he had left, I hurried to the steamer and there met him with two pilgrims from Ishqabád.  He said:  "Tell the friends, how, under severe circumstances of bodily weakness, I have accepted the hardships of travelling to promote the Word of God, to spread the Cause of God and to diffuse the Fragrances of God!  I have left behind friends, relatives and home for the sake of the Cause!"  By this he meant that the believers of
page 3
God must follow in his footsteps and illumine the East and the West with the lights of knowledge, peace and brotherhood.
While in Alexandria many noted persons, formerly enemies of the Cause for years, have met him and after being in his presence are changed entirely.  Also, distinguished editors of Arabic and Persian newspapers, such as Moaid and Tchehre Neina, have talked with him and afterward wrote and published columns of praise and commendation on his Teachings and greatness.  Thus the newspapers have given great publicity to the Faith.  In regard to the Moaid article, 'Abdu'l-Bahá says:  "A clipping from the newspaper of Moaid, which is the first newspaper of Egypt and its editor well known throughout the world for his learning, is enclosed.  Formerly, this person, through the instigation of some influential resident Persians, wrote many articles against this Cause and called the Bahá'ís infidels.  But when 'Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in this country, with one interview he was completely changed and contradicted all his former articles with this one.  This is the type of the just man!"
There is no doubt that this trip is fraught with wonderful results for the Cause and many people will become awakened.  In one of these interviews 'Abdu'l-Bahá stated he may go to Cairo and pass the remainder of the winter in that city.  The Egyptian winter weather is ideal, temperate and agrees with him.  Since he has arrived in Egypt his health is much improved, and should he decide to go to America it will not be before the springtime.
With great love and greeting to all the friends in the West, I am always
Your co-worker in the Cause,

Siyyid Asadu'lláh Gumí
Siyyid Asadu'lláh Gumí, who has sent the special news item pertaining to the journey of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to Egypt, published in this issue, is one of the oldest and most patriarchal Bahá'ís of the early days of Bahá'u'lláh.  He has served the Cause in many ways and is now living in Port Said as the channel of communication between the friends all over the world and 'Abdu'l-Bahá having been sent there from 'Akká to continue the work of the late Siyyid Taqí Manshádí.
While a young man he was eager to learn the truth from every source.  Later, he heard of the Bahá'í Revelation and, after a thorough investigation, accepted it.  He then began to teach and lead
Page 6
others.  On account of his open teaching, he was taken by the authorities of Tihrán and thrown into prison with the renowned Mírzá 'Abu'l-Fadl and eleven other prominent Bahá'ís.  After a year and a half in prison, suffering untold hardships-the recital of which is pathetic and soul stirring-he and others were set free.  About this time, Mírzá Asadu'lláh-who has been in America-and his family were preparing to leave Tihrán for 'Akká, and Siyyid Asadu'lláh Gumí volunteered to go with them.  Arriving at their destination, Siyyid Asadu'lláh begged Bahá'u'lláh to remain in His service, and for many years he was in turn a gardener in the Ridván and a teacher to the Bahá'í children in the Holy Land.
When Bahá'u'lláh departed from this life, for nine months Siyyid Asadu'lláh was instructed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the art of teaching the Truth; after which he sent him to Persia to spread the Cause.  Again he was apprehended in one of the remote cities of Persia, and with chains on his neck, hands and feet, was brought to Tihrán to be judged.  The Prime Minister, after investigation and finding him innocent, liberated him.  At this time 'Abdu'l-Bahá revealed to him some very glorious Tablets.
It was about the year 1900 that our editor, Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb, had the privilege of travelling with him through southern Persia, India and finally to 'Akká, and who testifies of Siyyid Asadu'lláh's gentleness, firmness, nobility of spirit and loftiness of mind.

Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Stating the conditions requisite for His coming to America
To the members of the Assemblies of Bahá'ís in America.11
To the beloved ones and the maid-servants of the Merciful!
HE IS GOD!
O ye dear friends and maid-servants of God!
Your epistle was received.12  You have expressed joy and happiness because of the trip of 'Abdu'l-Bahá from the centre of prison ('Akká) to the land of the divine Joseph (Egypt).  There are divine wisdoms in this journey!  I am hopeful that it will be productive of results.
Now-praise be to God-some time is passed with the utmost of spirit and fragrance in this country, and we are occupied with the service of the Cause of God and servitude to the Holy Threshold.
When the service which is our (present) purpose is realized for the Kingdom of God, perhaps we shall journey to other parts.
If the beloved of God in all America strive for unity and harmony, attain perfect love and accord, and act according to the divine teachings and the precepts of the Blessed Perfection, this will prove a magnet attracting 'Abdu'l-Bahá, so that, perchance, he may journey to America.
But, until the light of oneness, unity and love shine forth from the lamp of America, and the beloved act in accordance with the divine teachings and precepts of the Blessed Perfection, and all the believers in America become united and harmonious, my coming to America will be hindered-nay, impossible.
Therefore, strive ye that ye may become the em-
page 2
bodied teachings of the Blessed Perfection, confirmed in the divine precepts, resurrected in holiness and purity, severance, humility and meekness, set aglow with the fire of divine love; and loosen your tongues with the praises and commendations of the Heavenly Kingdom.
Thus may the great attainment be realized.  Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

I am hopeful that these conditions will be carried out, perchance at some time a trip to those regions may be taken; but if these conditions be not realized, this will hinder a trip to those parts.

'Abdu'l-Bahá is like the nightingale.  The nightingale soars to the rose-garden.  Should you desire my presence there, you must make America a rose-garden.  That is to say, you must make that country well adorned with every rose of spiritual qualities and human attributes.  Then certainly, God, the Generous, will reward you greatly, and, perchance, this Nightingale will then fly to that rose-garden.
Thou hast written of thy new house wherein thou hast prepared a place for the travellers of the East and West.  This is very acceptable.
Now the beloved must strive to make America a rose-garden.  Then your desire will be realized.
O thou dear maid-servant of God!  Thou art ever in mind and present before me.  I hope, through the bounty and bestowal of God, that thy dear son may be blessed and become dear in both worlds.

Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
New York City
To the friends of God and the maid-servants of the merciful in New York City.
Upon them be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O ye real friends and beloved maid-servants of God!
Your letter, through the maid-servant of God, Dr Clock, was received and perused.  Its contents imparted the utmost joy and happiness, for it indicated your advancement to the Kingdom of God, attraction with the love of God and supplication and prayer in the Threshold of God.
The friends and maid-servants of the Merciful must render service to the oneness of the human world and show love and affinity to all the children of men.  They must deal with the utmost devotion, good-will, love and kindness with all the communities, religions and sects.  Their aim and their work must be that the tree of their existence produce good fruits-and no fruit is greater than love and kindness toward all humanity.  His Highness Bahá'u'lláh addressing the world, says:  "Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the fruits of One branch." Therefore, the law of relationship, brotherhood, kinship, fatherhood and motherhood is established and proven among all the families of the human race.  Endeavour ye with all your hearts and souls so that ye may live and act in accord with these teachings of His Highness Bahá'u'lláh; to become an asylum to every oppressed one; to assist and uplift every vanquished one; to be a skilled physician to every sick one; to bestow a swift healing antidote to every wounded one; to inspire with confidence every fearful one; to grant tranquillity and composure to every agitated one; to gladden the heart of every depressed one; to become a salubrious water to every thirsty one; heavenly food to every hungry one; to become the
page 2
cause of glory to every fallen one and be charitable to all the poor ones.
Beware!  Beware! lest ye offend any heart!
Beware!  Beware! lest ye hurt any soul!
Beware!  Beware! lest ye deal unkindly toward any person!
Beware!  Beware! lest ye be the cause of hopelessness to any creature!
Should any soul become the cause of grief to any heart or despondency to any soul, it is better for him to hide himself in the lowest strata of the earth than to walk upon the earth.  Should any soul desire the abasement of his kind, undoubtedly his non-entity is better for him, for his non-existence is better than his existence and his death better than his life.
Therefore, my advice to you is, endeavour as much as ye can to show kindness toward all men, deal with perfect love, affection and devotion with all the individuals of humanity.  Remove from amongst yourselves racial, patriotic, religious, sectional, political, commercial, industrial and agricultural prejudices, so that you may become freed from all human restrictions and become the founders of the structures of the oneness of the world of humanity.  All the countries are one country; all the nations are the children of one Father.  The struggle for existence among the ferocious wolves has become the cause of all these differences and strifes; otherwise the expanse of the world is spacious and the table of the Bounties of the Almighty is spread in all the regions.

Your epistle dated 30 October reached me at Ramleh. ...  Regarding my coming to America and the assignment and preparation of homes or of places for me, I wrote a letter not long since through you to the maid-servant of God Lua (Getsinger) wherein I mentioned that abiding places in the hearts are needed; that is, the beloved in America must become united and assembled in love so that it

Convey my longing greetings to Mr Kinney.  Convey the utmost love to Mr Lennon.
I am hopeful through the bounty of God that the assemblies which were visited by you in the company of Lua will flourish and grow in the spread of the glad-tidings.
Regarding the beloved and the maid-servants of the Merciful in New York, and their securing a home in My Name wherein they gather together-in reality I am present among them in life and heart though absent in body.

The letter which thou best written in regard to the happiness and joy, beatitude and rejoicing of the American believers concerning the trip of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to the country of Joseph of Canaan, and likewise their expectation of my going to America was perused.  However, the latter event is depended upon several conditions which are already explained in a former Tablet.  The attractive power is necessary.
We must all with the utmost joy and cheerfulness sacrifice our lives for the Truth!  Consider how I have left aside a thousand works and with the greatest attraction am writing to thee with my own hand; so that in every moment thou mayst raise a wave and in devotion in the Love of God and the spending of thy life in the Cause, thou mayst make every possible effort.

'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt

A call to the American Bahá'ís
From Muhammad Yazdí.
Praise be to God! that 'Abdu'l-Bahá has left the gloomy city of imprisonment for the freedom of the world.  His only aim is to teach and raise the Standard of the Cause.  When he was under the surveillance of the authorities in 'Akká and confined to a limited prison life, he created the spirit of happiness and joy in every heart, and never complained, neither did he show distress or sadness on account of that imprisonment.  When freedom was proclaimed in Turkey, a constitution declared, the prisoners set free, and a new era of brotherhood and good fellowship ushered in among the various sects, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, while happy for the freedom of the people, longed for his own imprisonment.  His opinion was that under all circumstances he ought to serve the world of humanity, and while living in 'Akká he served it effectively, even though a prisoner; but being freed, nothing was left for him to do in 'Akká, and, like a bird released from its cage, he soared to other climes and countries.
'Abdu'l-Bahá in all his divine characteristics, is intensely human and keenly alive to the joys and sorrows of existence.  There is no one who feels more acutely the sufferings of humanity than he and no one loves his fellow-men more than he.  Here, in Alexandria, he lives exactly like other men; he goes into the stores, into the mosques, into the churches, into the schools and into the prisons.  He converses just as kindly and amiably with the humblest man in the street as with the highest in the land.  His matchless and magnetic kindness attracts all, whether ignorant or wise, rich or poor; be is no respecter of persons and in some instances, after a half-hour's conversation, his bitterest enemy has become his staunchest friend.
His coming into Egypt has added great enthusiasm and zeal to the hearts of the friends.  He has uplifted them from a state of comparative oblivion to a world-wide celebrity.  He is no more a possible myth or a fable; he is there, standing "powerful, mighty and supreme!"  The sun of his presence radiates the light of love and compassion; people
page 5
see him feel the wonderful influence of his presence, talk with him, walk with him as did the men of old walking with Jesus of Nazareth along the shores of Galilee.  They can no longer doubt him and his Teachings.
When he first arrived in Egypt, a great cry and clamour was raised by the representatives of the people (the newspapers).  All were expressing opinions of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  No one could form a just and impartial view of him.  Facts were exaggerated and misrepresentations abounded in every paper.  One writer expressed the opinion that 'Abdu'l-Bahá hates all religions, that his followers throughout the world are very few, and that his Teachings are destructive to the well-being and prosperity of human society.
Such were the conditions when 'Abdu'l-Bahá with his might and his glory, his meekness and humility, entered the land of Pharaoh.  But lo? after a short time the clouds of misrepresentation were dispelled and the light of reality shone forth with great splendour.  So much so, that at present there is not one dissenting voice in the land of Egypt about the greatness of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  Moggatam, one of the most influential Arabic newspapers, in a long article of 28 November 1910, comes out valiantly and defends in most eloquent terms the Teachings of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  Not being satisfied with this, the editor quotes from the Book of Aqdas wherein Bahá'u'lláh commands all despotic rulers to lay aside their absolutism and accept the constitution and establish in their kingdoms the Houses of Justice.  He even upbraids in the strongest terms the other newspaper writers, calling attention to the responsibilities and duties of their positions-that is, to mirror forth facts and realities and not falsehoods and accusations.  He says that every writer has been revelling in a riotous feast of exaggeration and derision; that they have gone beyond the limit of politeness and courtesy, which attributes differentiate man from beast.  Now, if we compare such articles with what first appeared concerning 'Abdu'l-Bahá, we will find them as different as day from night.
Some people have expressed anxieties and fears because of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's possible visit to America; they think that the newspapers will write sensational articles and ridicule the Cause.  Such people are very short-sighted.  They have not realized deep-
page 6
ly, nor superficially, the force of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's presence.  Neither have they dreamed of the magnetic influence of his Highness (rather his Kindness, ah, me!).  He is a man whose very appearance will solve all the perplexed anxieties of the visionaries of disaster.  We as Bahá'ís have nothing to be afraid of.  We are the spiritual physicians of the world; we are the torch-bearers of the ideal civilization; we are the teachers of the Kingdom of Abhá.  Should we be afraid to receive the One who is the source of all our inspiration and all our light?  America must raise a gladsome voice of spiritual beatitude, spread a heavenly banquet and be prepared, for "lie shall come as a thief in the night."  Future historians will record the coming of 'Abdu'l-Bahá to America as a great and momentous event.  Broaden your vision and look into the future, when the nations of America shall celebrate, from one end of the continent to the other, the anniversary of the day when 'Abdu'l-Bahá set foot upon "the land of the brave and the free!"  Future generations will sing in anthems and songs the resplendent glory of such a day.  Children will be taught to respect and love that day.  America is on the threshold of a great spiritual awakening, and it must arise to fulfil the responsibilities of such a wonderful and glowing promise.  'Abdu'l-Bahá has written to you in several Tablets that he will come as soon as the friends in that country are united as bands of steel or a golden chain of life.  Now it depends upon you.  You must show to the world that you are united, that you are worthy to receive him in your midst.  Let not this opportunity slip from your grasp.  Arise, work, band together, remove the difficulties from his path.  This day is not for fretting and discontentment, nor imagining the possibility of ridicule by the masses.  Have you not faith in him?  Has he not grappled with and solved the greatest problems for the past sixty years?  Has he not conversed with the wisest men of the age?  Again we say, prepare the way for his coming!  Let not your minds be troubled with outside questions.  He is able to change the ridicule into praise, the enmity into friendship and the derision into exaltation.  When he arrived in Alexandria we were not prepared to receive him.  There is no need of preparing houses and establishments for his reception; the probability is that he will take a place for him-
page 7
self when he arrives.  The first thing that he did when he arrived in Alexandria was to take a house, and all the friends from far and near flocked around him.  He does not want your houses and palaces, but your hearts.  Prepare your hearts, purify your hearts, cleanse your hearts, that he may find a place therein!
The life of 'Abdu'l-Bahá is simple; his attitude is humble:  his needs are very few.  You think that if he should come to America you must have a house prepared and surround him with luxuries of modern civilization.  Far from it!  With love, unity and harmony, shining like stars of heaven in your midst, a little cottage is greater than the imperial palace of the kings.  All through his life his sole purpose and aim has been to spread the fragrances of God, to serve the Kingdom of Abhá, and to sacrifice himself for the good of the world.  He has done all these; nay, rather, his services to man cannot be measured by any criterion.  His life, like unto a tempestuous sea, is ever in motion, casting pearls of significance and truth upon its shore.  Humanity owes to him a debt that can never be paid with money or gratitude.  Notwithstanding all he has done for the world, hearken to what he says in a recent Tablet:
"The invisible hand has opened the doors, and wisdom requires that 'Abdu'l-Bahá hasten to the country of Egypt; for he is infinitely ashamed and chagrined that he has not yet been assisted in servitude.  Perchance, through travelling in this land, he may be assisted in the future to some small service.  Now we are living in the country of Canaan and are supplicating day and night at the Threshold of Mercifulness and beg confirmation and assistance for the friends of God, so that all of us may participate and become partners in the servitude of the Holy Threshold and be aided in accomplishing one service."

Report from Sydney Sprague
[Extracts.]
... If we are asked the number of Bahá'ís in the world, is it not better to reply that it is impossible to know, and that we care much more about the quality of the believers than the quantity?  This is the policy of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, as the following incident will show:
Two nights ago, an American journalist, Mr William Ellis, representing The Continent, came especially to Alexandria to interview 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  It was my privilege to be the translator on this occasion.  One of the first questions Mr Ellis asked was:  "How many followers have you?"  The answer was:  "We have no statistics and we do not consider these things important.  It is the quality of the believers we care for.  If a few are characterized with the attributes of God and live according to the divine Teachings, it is praiseworthy.  Five diamonds are worth more than five million stones."  Again the journalist asked:  "Have you not many followers in America'!"  "I have a few friends in different cities who love me," was the reply.  "Is it not true that half of Persia is Bahá'í?" persisted the journalist.  "No; it is not," replied 'Abdu'l-Bahá, "but many there who are not Bahá'ís, are influenced by our Teachings."  "Are there not many followers in the Turkish Empire?"  "No," and again 'Abdu'l-Bahá reiterated the non-importance of numbers.  The journalist seemed very much taken aback.  He evidently expected 'Abdu'l-Bahá to boast of a large following.  What an example 'Abdu'l-Bahá has set us!
Then Mr Ellis asked briefly:  "What are the Teachings of the Bahá'í Revelation and in what does it differ from other religions?"  'Abdu'l-Bahá replied:  "While all the other religions are hating and denouncing each other, the Bahá'ís are the friends of all religions and the lovers of all peoples, and their aim is to unite and harmonize all."  There were many other questions which drew forth wonderful, illuminating explanations from 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  I have not the time to write them now, but he on the lookout for an account of this interview in The Continent.  Mr Ellis is on his way to Persia to write articles about that country, so he may write of the Cause there.
page 9
... When Mr Ellis asked him if he was benefited by the change of air, he replied:  "Certainly, one who has been a prisoner for forty years must he benefited to breathe another air."

Thou art the first paper of the Bahá'ís which is organized in the country of America.  Although for the present thy subscribers are limited, thy form is small and thy voice weak, yet shouldst thou stand unshakeable, become the object of the attention of the friends and the centre of the generosity of the leaders of the faith who are firm in the Covenant, in the future thy subscribers will become hosts after hosts like unto the waves of the sea; thy volume will increase, thy arena will

Message from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to "The Christian Commonwealth"
30 November 1910.
To the Editor of The Christian Commonwealth.
My Dear Friend:  I have received your letter, for the contents of which I am extremely grateful to you.  I understand the aims of your movement, and hope that with the greatest spirituality and by the pursuit of truth, it will succeed in bringing about the unification of mankind.
Enclosed you will find some of the sayings of Bahá'u'lláh:  insert them in The Christian Commonwealth.
Be so kind as to accept for yourself and your honourable society my kindest regards.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
The extracts enclosed from the sayings of Bahá'u'lláh illustrate the universality of the Bahá'í outlook.  We quote the following:
"Today the universal religion of God, the great Church of God, is divided into diverse faiths which are at enmity one with the other.  All the powerful
page 5
religions have appeared in the East; their differences arise only from the necessities of epoch, time, or century.  O people of Bahá, therefore fasten securely the girdle of endeavour so that the discussions and strifes between the various sects of the world may be destroyed.  For the love of God, I call upon you, His servants, to bestir yourselves, in this momentous matter!"
"Associate with all religions in reverence and with tolerance."
"O peoples of the world!  Ye are all leaves of the same branch and plants in the same garden; live in love, concord, friendship and union.  I declare by the Sun of Truth that it is the light of fellowship which makes the heavens full of brightness."
"If you possess a saying, a treasure, of which other peoples are deprived, tell it to them with affection ....  The message of the prophets, the revelations of the sacred scriptures have no other aim but the knowledge of God, and the unity of mankind."
"O peoples, do not spill blood and do not seize the goods of others.  By my life, the sword of good character and kindness is sharper than a sword of iron.  Those men are truly wise who are decorated with the ornaments of science and character; these are the head of the body of mankind.  The ruling of man has always been in their hands.  I ask God to assist them to do what He wishes, what pleases Him.  Truly He is the Master of creation, the Lord of the beginning and of the end!"

Verily I read thy letter which indicated thy steadfastness in the Covenant of God and evinced thy walking in the Straight Path toward the Kingdom of God.
Verily I entered in the country of Egypt, trusting in God, attracted to His Kingdom and enkindled with the Fire of His Love, hoping to arise in the Servitude of the Threshold of Bahá, and I am always, day and night, serving.  There is no rest, tranquillity or composure.
I beg of God to encircle ye with the Most Great Bounty and confirm ye with the Most Eminent Grace which consists of building the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of America in Chicago!  This foundation will have the greatest effect in the hearts of the people of faithfulness.  Therefore, endeavour ye with all your power and generosity so that ye may raise this first foundation in the Name of Bahá on the continent of America.
I supplicate God to pour upon thee heavenly blessings and that thy family be protected from every sadness and sorrow in this world.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!

Madame Aurelia Bethlen
Through Mr MacNutt and Mírzá Ahmad to Madame Aurelia Bethlen.
HE IS GOD!
O thou seeker of Truth!
The letter which thou hast written through Mr MacNutt was received.  As he is a beloved channel, I will immediately answer your letter, although I have little time.
You have expressed your longing for my presence in that country.  Although I, too, have infinite longing to meet the believers on that continent, yet that region must attain to the capacity of attracting the presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  A harmonious and wonderful banquet must be prepared, at which every kind of heavenly food may be served:  after which you may send me an invitation.
That heavenly food consists of deeds which are in accord with the Divine Teachings.  The first food is the Love of God.  The second food is the attraction to the breaths of the Holy Spirit.  The third food is union and harmony among all the believers.  The fourth food is sincerity, trustworthiness, kindness, purity of intention and service to all humankind.
Should ye prepare and serve such a delicious, sweet and tempting banquet unquestionably 'Abdu'l-Bahá will hasten to America to partake of that food.  Therefore endeavour ye with all your might that this Food be prepared.
Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

Through Dr Faríd to the near maid-servant of God, the daughter of the Kingdom, Marie Watson.
Upon her be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O thou candle of the Love of God!
Thy letter was received.  Thou hast written that the daughter of the Kingdom, Ásíyih, is studying Persian, and that thou art teaching Mírzá Faragollah Khán, English.
Turn to the Kingdom of Abhá, seek assistance and put forth effort so that all may soon learn Persian, and his honour, Mírzá Faragollah Khán may also acquire the mastery of the English tongue.
Thou hast learned of the conditions of my coming to America.  I beg of God that the beloved in America may become so enlightened that the lights of their love may flood the "Turk and the Tajik," and that an attractive magnet may be brought forth in that country, capable of attracting 'Abdu'l-Bahá with all power to those regions, and this is not far from His Mercy.
Regarding the meeting you have established in New York:  I hope that through the Divine Confirmation it may prove to be a gathering of the Love of God.
Convey the utmost kindness from me to the daughter of Mr and Mrs Sheber, Marguerite, the daughter of the Kingdom, and say that the olive tree is an emblem of peace and concord, and the olive is the fruit and result thereof.
God willing thou shalt attain the delicious fruit of peace and concord and thou shalt place a bouquet of roses from the Garden of the Paradise of Abhá at the Heavenly Feast spread before 'Abdu'l-Bahá, i.e., God willing thou shalt attain such perfections as resemble a bouquet of flowers and thou shalt offer it to the heavenly table.
Thou hast written that in a house of a Theosophist thou prepared a feast of joy and a fête of gladness.  This Society is ready for hearing the Word of God.  Treat them with the utmost love, kindness, unity and oneness, so that the attractive power of the Word of God may draw them to the Sun of Reality.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

Thy letter dated 19 January 1911, was received.  You have written of the good news from California and from Chicago.

If the beloved of God should unite and should agree as it is requisite, thou canst rest assured that in the shortest space of time the Sun of the Heavens (spiritual heavens) will so shine from the Kingdom of Abhá as to rend asunder all the veils of superstitions.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!

Fragment of a Tablet to Dr Faríd
In a recent Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to Dr Faríd, the following appears:  "God willing, through the endeavour of the friends in America, may the Bird of Paradise be revealed in all its beauty in the Philippine Islands."  This refers to a command received some time ago that the Cause would be served exceedingly if one or two of the friends would journey to the Philippines and convey the Message there.

'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt
Fifth of a series of special news items pertaining to the sojourn of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in Egypt.
The following article concerning 'Abdu'l-Bahá ('Abbás Effendi) appeared in the 19 January issue of "El Ahram" (The Pyramids), an Arabic newspaper printed in Cairo:
'Abbás Effendi the Leader of the Bahá'ís
Statements regarding his morals and religion
Continually, the greatness of the Leader of the Bahá'ís, 'Abbás Effendi, is the topic of conversation, among the men of affairs and statesmen.  The wise men of Alexandria, and the nobility of that city are paying him great respect and homage.  Latterly he has received many letters from his numerous followers in the United States, requesting him to travel to those parts so that they may meet him.  They have prepared a great house in New York in accord with his station and position amongst them.  However, it is probable that he will not respond to their invitation, on account of the remoteness of the country and the length of the trip.
We have received a letter from the celebrated scholar, Schokry Effendi, who has just arrived from Syria, in which he praises 'Abbás Effendi, explains his religion and produces certain arguments in his favour.
He says:  "The wisdom of 'Abbás Effendi, our respected guest, descends from a family which was noble in lineage and descent in the Kingdom of Persia.  He is the son of the 'Dweller of Paradise', Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, and he is the successor of his Father.  In regard to his morality and character, he is the pattern of dignity and perfection.  He is gracious, generous, noble-minded, philanthropic, charitable and full of benevolence.  He is very kind to the poor and patient to the indigent.  He does not make any difference between the followers of any religion, whether they be Christians, Jews, Muslims or Brahmans.  To him all are the same, he looks upon them as part of the same family of humanity and not their particular religion.  The aim of his Faith is the unity of religions in the world and their equality among the children of men.  He thinks that the differences of religions are impeding the progress of the world' and he believes that the removal of these differences will benefit mankind.
"This religion has spread greatly and is carried to Europe and America so much so that today the number of Bahá'ís has reached the number of fifteen million, men, women and children included.  Many of these Bahá'ís are in New York, Chicago and India, Persia, Egypt and Syria, and it is continually growing and spreading.
"The Tomb of Bahá'u'lláh is in 'Akká, called Bahjí and every year the Bahá'ís come from all parts of the world to visit it.
"Twice I have called upon 'Abbás Effendi while in Ramleh and have seen the poor and indigent gathered around his house waiting for him to come out and when he appears, they beg alms and he gives to them.  This is just a short sketch of his generous qualities and I confess my inability to do it justice.  His physical appearance is medium size, white hair, penetrating eyes, smiling face and wonderful countenance, courteous, and his manner, simplicity itself, disliking any ostentation and
page 5
show.  He is a wise man a philosopher and his knowledge of the Turkish, Persian and Arabic is unsurpassed.
"He knows the history of nations and understands the causes of their rise and fall.
"He is sixty years old and on account of certain nervous ailments he has come to Egypt for change of air.  He personally reads all the articles and letters sent him from all parts of the world, and answers the most important of them in his Persian hand writing which is famous for its beauty.  Many of the great men of this country and delegates from other nations have met him and he gives a personal interview to each one of them.  No one has visited him without leaving him impressed by his presence and praising his qualities and wondering at his magnanimity and his astonishing mind.
"Concerning the reports of his leaving 'Akká and the statement that he is against the Constitution, this was without foundation and the proof of this is his endeavour to unite the religions in the world and establish equality among nations.  If such were his qualities, working against religions and constitution, and on the other hand trying to bring union and harmony amongst them, how can we reconcile the two?  This is indeed far from him, for he is a man who advocated the Constitution from the very beginning and before the Turkish people received their Constitution.  But the real object of his coming to Egypt is for the change of air and his physical condition.  This is the real truth we are proclaiming at the top of our voice and if there is any virtue in it, it requires no praise or blame."

Tablet concerning the School of Tarbíyat
The following Tablet has been received from 'Abdu'l-Bahá in regard to the important matter of sending two teachers to the School of Tarbíyat:
HE IS GOD.
O Thou Servant of the Blessed Perfection!
They have written from Tihrán that there is need of a scientific teacher for the School of Tarbíyat.  He must be efficient in science as well as the English language; for at present there is no man in the School of Tarbíyat who is a scientist or linguist.  They are in need of both, science and the English language.
Therefore, consult with the believers of God and select one soon, from among the American Bahá'ís, who is efficient in science and arts, and send him to Tihrán.  He will receive a salary sufficient to sustain him with the utmost ease while there.
Likewise select a woman teacher who may fill the position of principal as well as teacher, and send her without delay.  The woman must have a share of the knowledge of sciences and be proficient in woman's work, such as sewing, housekeeping, hygiene and household economics, etc.
This matter is very necessary, and you must give to it the utmost importance and exert yourselves to bring this about; so that the association of the Interdependence of the West may render assistance to the East.

HE IS GOD!
O ye believers who are attracted to the Centre of Lights!
Verily there have been various assemblies in America which were organized many times and out of these but few remained firm.
I supplicate to the Divine Majesty for the establishment of every assembly which hath turned its face towards God, left the scattered desires, abandoned the self and passion and become firm in the Cause of God as solid mountains, which are not agitated by the winds and violent storms.
Then, O ye maid-servants of the Merciful, it is incumbent upon ye to be firm, sincere and highly energetic and in great unity; severed from all save God; effaced and annihilated in the love of God; sacrificing yourselves under all conditions and circumstances; and glorious, so that ye may be filled with the love of Bahá and that in ye nothing remains except the abundance of Bahá.  Should ye arise for these great gifts, ye may rest assured that the confirmations of the Holy Spirit will follow ye in every time and instant.

New Year's greeting from 'Abdu'l-Bahá16
HE IS GOD!
O ye children of the Kingdom!
It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the cycle of the year.  A year is the expression of a cycle (of the sun); but now is the beginning of a cycle of Reality, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a New Time and a New Year.  Therefore, it is very blessed.
I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest in the faces and characteristics of the believers, so that they, too, may become a new people, and having found new life and been baptized with fire and spirit, may make the world a new world, to the end that the old earth may disappear and the new earth appear; old ideas depart and new thoughts come; old garments be cast aside and new garments put on; ancient politics whose foundation is war be discarded and modern politics founded on peace raise the standard of victory; the new star shine and gleam and the new sun illumine and radiate; new flowers bloom; the new spring become known; the new breeze blow; the new
page 11
bounty descend; the new tree give forth new fruit; the new voice become raised and this new sound reach the ears, that the new will follow the new, and all the old furnishings and adornments be cast aside and new decorations put in their places.
I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and partake of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and endeavour until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly behaviour; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turned into the olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the Love of God and the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death the soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as one race; and all national anthems harmonized into one melody.  Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth Heaven and the world of Satan become the world of Angels.

O thou beloved maid-servant of God!
Your detailed letter was perused and from its contents it became evident that the debt on the land of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár is clear.  This news made the hearts happy and caused infinite rejoicing.
Now it is hoped that the believers of God may show magnanimity and raise a great sum for the building, so that the foundation of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár may be laid, and, perchance, God willing, the cornerstone of the foundation may be laid by the hands of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.

This confirmation will descend upon the people of America if they will all arise and endeavour with great courage to establish union and harmony, so that every trace of difference may be uprooted and they may all become as one heart and one soul.

Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh
To the Sultán of Turkey.17
Describing the sufferings of himself and his followers, after his arrival in 'Akká.
HE IS THE POSSESSOR IN HIS MIGHT AND POWER!
The Supreme Pen proclaims:
O, thou personage, who considerest thyself the greatest of all men, while looking upon the Divine Youth, thinking him to be the lowest of men, yet through him the Eye of the Supreme Concourse is brightened and illumined.  This Youth has never made nor will he ever make a request of thee:  For from the beginning every one of the Manifestations of Mercifulness and the dawning-Places of the Glory of the Almighty, who have stepped forth from the Realm of Immortality upon the arena of existence and shone forth with great splendour for the quickening of the dead, men like thee have considered those Sanctified Souls and Temples of Oneness upon whom the reformation of the world depends, as the people of strife, and wrong-doers.  Verily, their names (the deniers) are forgotten and ere long thy name will also be forgotten and thou shalt find thyself in great loss.  According to thy opinion this quickener of the World and its Peace-Maker is culpable and seditious.  What crime have the women, children and suffering babes committed, to merit thy wrath, oppression and hate?  In every religion and community the children are considered innocent, nor does the Pen of Divine Command hold them responsible, yet the reign of thy tyranny and despotism has surrounded them.  If thou art the follower of any religion or sect, read thou the Heavenly Books, the Inspired Epistles and the Divine Writings, so that thou mayest realize the irresponsibility of children.  On the other hand, even those people who do believe in God, have never committed such crimes.  In everything an effect is hidden, and no one has denied the effects of things except an ignorant one who is completely denied and deprived of intelligence.  Therefore, undoubtedly the lamentation of these children and the cries of these wronged ones will produce a great effect.
You have persecuted a number of souls who have shown no opposition your country and who have instigated no revolution against the government; nay, rather, days and nights they have been peacefully engaged in the mentioning of God.  You have pillaged their properties and through your tyrannical acts, all they had was taken from them.  When the order was issued for the banishment of this Youth, these souls began to lament, but the officers who constituted my guard mentioned that these souls had committed no wrong, nor has the government banished them, but if they desire they may follow you for no one will oppose them.  Consequently, they paid all their own
page 4
expenses and leaving their property behind, they were contented with the Countenance of this Youth and trusting upon God they departed again with the True One, until the fortress of 'Akká became the place of the incarceration of Bahá'.  The day after the arrival, the officials of the army surrounded the men, women and children and carried them to the gloomy dungeon of the barrack.  The first night they were given neither bread nor water, for the sentinels were guarding the door of the prison and permitted no one to leave the place.  They did not consider the plight of these wronged ones.  Water was asked for, but it was refused.  It is now some time since we are all imprisoned in this dungeon; although we were living for five years in Adrianople and all the people, whether ignorant or wise, rich or poor, testified to the sanctity and holiness of these servants.
When departing from Adrianople one of the believers of God sacrificed himself with his own hand, for he could not see this Wronged One in the hands of the tyrants.  On our way we were transferred three times, from one ship to another, and it is evident that a number of the children suffered under these severe circumstances.  When we left the steamer, they separated four of the friends from us, and prevented them from following, and upon the departure of this Youth, one of the four, named 'Abdu'l-Gaffar, threw himself into the sea and no one has ever found any trace of him.  This is a drop of the ocean of persecution which surrounded and encircled us.  Notwithstanding these things, they are not yet satisfied, and every day the officers of the government are increasing their hard-heartedness, nor is it ended; day and night they are forming new intrigues and adding to our sufferings.  From the government supplies, these prisoners receive three loaves of bread to last for twenty-four hours, and no one is able to eat it.
From the beginning of the world, no such persecutions have been seen or heard of!  I declare by the One who has commanded Bahá to speak, between the heavens and the earth, there is no name or mention for you equal to those who sacrificed their spirits, bodies and property for the love of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent!  Before God, a handful of dust is greater than your kingdom, sovereignty, glory and dominion, and should He desire, He would scatter you as the sand of the desert, and ere long His wrath shall overtake thee, revolutions shall appear in your midst and your countries will be divided!  Then you will weep and lament and nowhere will you find help and protection.  The mentioning of these facts is not for the sake of your becoming mindful, for already the wrath of God has surrounded you, but you have not nor will you become mindful; neither is it for the sake of reciting the persecutions which have descended upon these holy souls, for they are intoxicated with the Wine of the Merciful and they are so exhilarated with the clear Salsabil of Divine Providence, that should the persecutions of all the world descend upon them in the Path of God, they are satisfied, nay, rather, grateful; they never had nor will they ever have any complaints to offer.  At every moment the blood in their bodies begs and supplicates from the Lord of both worlds, that it be shed upon the ground in His Path; likewise their heads yearn to be raised upon a spear for the sake of the Beloved of the heart and soul.  For several times the tests of God have descended upon you, and you were not mindful; one was a conflagration which burned the city with the Fire of Justice, so much so that poets have composed poems about it, declaring that such a conflagration has never appeared before; notwithstanding this your negligence increased.  Then the cholera came, and still you remained heedless.  Be ye watchful, for the wrath of God is prepared, and ere long ye shall behold that which is descended from the Pen of Command.  Have ye
page 5
thought that your glory is everlasting, or did ye dream that your kingdom would remain forever?  No, by the life of God!  Your glory is not eternal, and our humiliation will not last.  This humiliation is the diadem of all the glories, and only man in his perfection can comprehend it.
When this Youth was a child and had not yet reached the age of maturity, one of my brothers intended to marry in Tihrán and according to the custom of that country, for seven days and nights they were engaged in feasting and banqueting.  The programme for the last day of the entertainments for the guests was the play of Sultán Salím.  The ministers, the grandees and officials of the city were there in a great throng, and this Youth was sitting in one of the galleries of the building and was observing the scenes.  Then they raised a great tent in the middle of the court; representations of human forms only a few inches in height would come out of the tent and cry:  "The king is coming, arrange the seats in order."  Then the other figures came out, sweeping the round while a number were sprinkling the streets with water; then another picture was presented, who was supposed to be the herald, acquainting the people to be ready for review before His Majesty, the Sultán.
Then the ministers came, with hat and shawl, according to the Persian custom; others were present with clubs, while a number of others were garbed chamberlains, aides-de-camp, farráshes and executioners with instruments of punishment.  All these men were lined according to their station and class.  At last the king appeared, with sovereign power and shining diadem upon his head, and with splendour and glory walked slowly and majestically, and with perfect calmness, tranquillity and composure, seated himself upon the throne.  At that moment the noise of the guns and the music of the national anthem was raised, and the smoke surrounded the tent and the king.  When the air was cleared, it was seen that the king was on his throne, and the ministers, the magistrates and secretaries had taken their places according to their rank.  Immediately, a thief, captured by the police, was brought before the king, and royal order was issued to behead him.  Then the chief of the executioners took the captive and decapitated him, and a red fluid, which was like blood, was seen by all the spectators.  While the Sultán was consulting with some of his ministers, the news was brought in that a certain person had become a rebel.  The Sultán issued orders that several regiments of soldiers and artillery men be sent to the scene and quell the disturbance.  After a few minutes the thunderous noise of guns and artillery was heard behind the tent, and we were told they were engaged in battle.  This Youth became astonished and bewildered at these affairs.  Then the review ended and the curtain descended.
After twenty minutes a man came out from behind the tent with a box under his arm.  I asked him, "What is this box?  Where is the king and all the men?"  He answered that all these great things and manifest objects, such kings, princes and ministers, glory, majesty, power and sovereignty that we beheld were enclosed in this box.
I declare by the Lord who has created all things through His Word, that from that day all the conditions of this world and its greatness are like that play before the eyes of this Youth.  It has not nor will ever have the weight of a mustard seed.  I was wondering greatly that the people glorify themselves in these affairs, notwithstanding this, the people of insight will discern with the eye of certainty the end of the glory of every great one before beholding it.  I have seen nothing except I have discerned its transiency, and God testifies to this.  It is incumbent upon every soul in these few days of life to spend them in truthfulness and justice and if he be not confirmed with the knowledge of the True One, he can at least walk in the path of equity and intelligence.
page 6
Ere long all these apparent things, manifest treasuries, worldly wealth, valiant soldiers, beautiful dresses and haughty souls, will he enclosed in the box-like tomb, similar to the box which contained all the players, and all this quarrel, strife and so-called honours are like the play of the children before the people of insight.  Be ye admonished, and be not of those who see the Truth and yet deny.  These things will not affect this Youth and the friends of the True One, for they are all prisoners and enchained, and will not nor will ever make any request of people like thee.
The point is this, that thou mayest raise thy head from the bed of negligence and become mindful and not oppose the servants of God without reason.  Bear in mind that so far as power and strength remain in the body, thou shouldst remove persecutions from the oppressed ones.  Shouldst thou have a little justice and behold with the eye of certainty in the affairs and differences of the ephemeral world, thou shalt acknowledge that all of them are like unto the above-mentioned play.  Hearken unto the word of Truth!  Be thou not proud on account of the world.  Where are those people who were like unto thee, who claimed divinity in this earth without the permission of God, and desired to extinguish the Light of God and to demolish the foundation of Truth?  Dost thou see any one of them?  Be just!  Then turn to God, perchance He may forgive the sins thou hast committed in this ephemeral life.  Yet we know that thou shalt not become assisted in this, for through thy tyranny the Fire of Sinai flamed forth, the Spirit wept, and the hearts of the angels bled.
O, ye people of the earth!  Hearken to the voice of this Oppressed One with the ear of the soul, and ponder ye deeply over the above-mentioned story.  Perchance ye may not be burned with the fire of passion and desire, and be not prevented from the meeting of the True One, through the worthless things of the faithless world.  Glory and abasement, poverty and wealth, trouble and tranquillity, all shall pass away, and ere long all the inhabitants of the earth shall return to the tomb.  Therefore every possessor of insight must behold the immortal outlook, that peradventure, through the Bounties of the Eternal Sovereign, he may enter into the everlasting Kingdom and rest under the shade of the Tree of Command.  Although the world is the place of treachery and duplicity, yet under all circumstances it reminds all the people with the idea of change.  The passing of the father is an admonition for the son, and it reminds him that he, too, must pass away.  It would have been well if the people of the world who are amassing great fortunes and are deprived of the True One, knew what would become of their great wealth.  By the Life of Bahá, no one is cognizant of this fact except God, Glorified is His Station!
The philosopher, Avicenna-peace be upon him-says:  "Be admonished, O ye whose hearts are darkened, be ye admonished O ye, whose faces are covered with the lines of age!" However, the majority of the people are asleep.  The example of those souls is like unto a person who was so intoxicated with wine that he was showing the signs of affection to a dog, and showering upon him tender words of love and affection.  When the morning of intelligence dawned, and the horizons of the heaven were illumined with the brilliant orb, he beheld that his beloved was only a dog; when ashamed regretful and remorseful on account of his act, he returned to his home.
Do thou not think that thou hast made this Youth powerless, or that thou hast conquered him.  Thou art defeated by one of the servants, but knowest it not.  The worst and lowest of creatures ruled over thee, and that is thy passion and desire, which has been condemned forever.  If it were not on account of the consummate Wisdom of God thou wouldst have seen thy

weakness and the weakness of the people of the earth.  This humility is the glory of My Cause, wert thou to know!  This Youth has never loved nor will ever love to utter any word which is against courtesy.  Verily, courtesy is My Garment with which we have adorned the temples of our favourite servants.  Otherwise some of thy actions that thou thinkest are unknown, would be mentioned in this Tablet.  O, thou possessor of might!  These little children and these friends of God did not need the officers and soldiers as guards.  After our arrival, one of the officers presented himself and after much conversation expressed his own innocence and thy crime.  This Youth mentioned to him that:  "Primarily, it was necessary to bring about a meeting of the Ulamas of the time and Himself so that the crimes of which these servants are accused might become evident.  However, time has passed and according to thy statement thou art commanded to imprison us in the 'most desolate city.' But I have one wish to make of thee, and that is to request of His Majesty, the Sultán, to grant Me an audience of ten minutes in order that he may ask proofs and arguments which he thinks would establish the validity of the Word of God.  If the proofs which he desires are made manifest on the part of God, he should then liberate these wronged ones and leave them to their own condition."
He promised to take this message and send an answer, but we heard nothing more from him; although it is not the Station of this True One to present Himself before any person, for all the people are created for His worship:  Yet for the sake of these little children and the number of women who are away from their country and people, we volunteered this act, but notwithstanding this, no result was produced.  Omar is living and ready, ask of him so that the Truth may become manifest to thee.  Now all these exiled ones are sick and lying in prison.  No one but God the Mighty, the Glorious, knows what will happen to us.
During the first days two of these servants passed into the Supreme Concourse.  One day one of the officers commanded that they could not remove those blessed bodies unless they were paid for the shroud and casket, although no one ever asked anything of them.  At that time we possessed no means, and when we insisted that they leave the work to us and allow the friends to prepare the dead for burial, they refused.  Finally they took a rug to the bazaar and sold it at auction, and delivered the money to the officers.  Later on it became evident that they only dug the ground and laid the two blessed bodies in the one grave, although they had been doubly paid for shrouds and caskets.  The pen is unable and the tongue is powerless to describe that which has descended upon us; however, all these poisons of tests are sweeter to this Youth than honey.  I pray that under all circumstances the trials of the world in the Path of God and the Love of the Merciful may descend upon this Ocean of Significances.  We beg of Him patience and endurance.
Thou art weak, and knowest it not.  Couldst thou realize and be perfumed with the fragrance wafted from the direction of the Ancient Beauty, thou wouldst leave everything that thou hast in hand and hasten to come and live in one of the ruined rooms of this Most Great Prison.  Ask thou of God that thou mayest attain to the age of maturity so that thou mayest recognize the beauty and ugliness of deeds and actions.  Peace be upon those who follow guidance!

Words of Bahá'u'lláh
O my servant!  O Joseph!  Hear the tone of God and do not compare this day with any other day, neither the wonderful, sweet Word of God with any other words; look to the apparent matters with thine own eye and do not follow anyone in knowing the Greatest and Brilliant Orb.
In this day, the beloved of God must not hesitate or delay an instant in teaching the Cause of the Manifestation, and must summon the people continually, with great admonition and conciliating words, to the Religion of Majestic Oneness; because, verily, in this day, to the soul who is the cause of guidance to another soul the recompense of a martyr in the way of God will be assuredly recorded by the Pen of the Cause, for his deed.

The difference between material civilization and divine civilization
Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá18
To Mr Arthur S. Agnew, Chicago Illinois.
Upon him be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
Thou Servant of the Beauty of Abhá!
I received thy letter, and the books that thou hadst sent have been received.  Convey, on my behalf, most wonderful Abhá, greetings unto Mr Herbert R. Windust, Miss Gertrude Buikema and Miss Mary Lesch.  During hours of leisure, when in the middle of the night I engage in supplications, I shall beg for assistance and favour in their behalf.  Indeed, they have made a great effort in the printing and publication of the Letters (i.e., Tablets).19
As to the difference between the natural (i.e., physical or material civilization which is in the present day in force, and the Divine civilization shall be of the results of The House of Justice:  The material civilization prevents and safeguards people from committing evil deeds, through the force of the laws of retaliation and correction.  Thus, you see how prohibitory laws and rules of correction are constantly in circulation and yet, by no means, any (adequate) law of retribution is to be found; and in all the cities of Europe and America spacious prison buildings have been founded and established for correcting and punishing the criminals.
But the Divine civilization will so train mankind that no soul will commit crimes, except rare (or few) individuals, which exception is of no importance whatsoever.  Consequently, there is much difference between preventing people from evil actions and crimes through correction and retaliation or through violent punishment, and so training them, enlightening them and
page 4
spiritualizing them that they will shun crimes and evil deeds without any fear (however) of punishment, prevention or retaliation.  Nay, they will consider crimes themselves as the greatest punishment and mightiest retribution, will be attracted to the virtues of the human world and devotedly spend their lives in that which is conducive to the enlightenment of mankind and to spreading qualities acceptable in the Threshold of the Almighty.
Consequently, consider what a difference and distinction is there between the material civilization and the Divine civilization!  The natural civilization prevents men from doing harm and wrong through force and punishment and thus withholds them from committing crimes.  But the Divine civilization so trains men that the human individuals avoid sins without having any fear from (material) punishment; and the very sin itself becomes unto them as the severest punishment.  And they will engage in acquiring human virtues, gaining that by which mankind will be uplifted and that which will enlighten the human world with the utmost zeal and fervour.
O Thou Creator!  Bring the American friends nigh unto the Kingdom of Abhá and suffer their deeds and actions to be in conformity with the Commandments and Exhortations written in the Tablets.  Make them firm in Thy Love and steadfast in Thy Cause.  Attract them unto the Bahá'í Beauty and cause them to attain infinite warmth and fervour.  Bestow upon them a firm footing and give them a heavenly power in order that they may engage in Thy service and spread the Signs of the Kingdom.
Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty!  Thou art the Compassionate, the Gracious, the Seer!
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
Convey, on my behalf, the most wonderful Abhá, greeting to his honour, Mr MacNutt and Mrs MacNutt.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

Extract from recent Tablet to the friends in Khurásán, Persia
The news of the attraction of the hearts of the believers of God ignited the candle of happiness and created spiritual joy.  'Abdu'l-Bahá travelled to the land of Joseph of Canaan and became well known in the servitude of the Holy Threshold.  Although the attack of the sects and the false rumours and statements in the newspapers are intense, yet it is my hope that this journey may become fruitful and the Voice and Summons of the Cause of God may move these regions; some seeds may be sown and watered and be assisted by the downpour of the rain of the Mercy of the Almighty.  Assuredly they will grow and become green and verdant.
Praise be to God! that through the Bounty and Favour of the Most Great Name-May my life he a sacrifice to His believers-the Voice of the Cause of God is raised in all countries and the Fame and Melody of the Word of God is spread in every region.  In these days the Cause of God is progressing and advancing in America, and in Asia there is the clamour of Turk and Tajik.  The Bahá'ís have founded an English newspaper in the capital of Japan, which is edited and circulated by his honour, the learned Professor Báriku'l-Alláh, of India.  Some of the American believers are expecting to make a trip to China and Manchuria so that they may raise the Voice of the Kingdom in those parts, and in Europe and Asia the Trumpet of the Supreme Concourse is heard.
God be praised!  Notwithstanding this divine, Majestic Cause, the promotion of the Word of God and the diffusion of the Fragrances of God, a few impotent ones, who are less than the flies, desire to break the Covenant and violate the Testament.  How fruitless and weak is their endeavour!  The screech of the owl is discordant before the Melody of the Kingdom and the cawing of the crow is drowned before the harmony of the
page 5
Nightingale of Significance; the weak bat with its shattered broken wing cannot soar with the white-winged Gabriel, and the darkness of humiliation and remorse cannot cover the rays of the Sun of Truth.  Were there any justice they would all testify that this Pen is not moving the East and the West except through the Confirmation of the Blessed Perfection, and this Melody is not imparting rejoicing and delight to the world except through the assistance of the Most Great Name.  When the blind souls deny the existence of the sun, they think they have accomplished a great feat, while heedless of the fact that they have proved more than anything else their own ignorance.

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in America
[Letter by Percy F. Woodcock, 21 April 1911.]
...
One day, the Editor of an American journal, in an interview with 'Abdu'l-Bahá asked, "Have you many followers in America?"  'Abdu'l-Bahá replied, "I have a few friends in different cities who love Me." ....
When we left New York last January for Egypt, we carried with us many supplications and earnest entreaties from sincere and loving souls, begging us to ask 'Abdu'l-Bahá for a final word as to his wish in connection with the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, saying, that many demands were being made upon them for money to support other enterprises which were represented as of equal importance as the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár; that they were in a state of perplexity and uncertainty as to their duty in this important matter.
'Abdu'l-Bahá said, "When you return to America, call together those sincere souls who have asked this question and say:  The most important thing in this day is the speedy erection of this Edifice (the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár).  Its mystery is great and cannot be unveiled just yet.  In the future it will be made plain.  I want everyone left free to act as he wills.  If anyone wishes to put money into other things, let him do so.  Do not interfere with him in, any way.  But be assured, the most important thing at this time is the building of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár."
Percy F. Woodcock.
P.S.-A Tablet recently received by Mr Mountfort Mills contains the following:  "Announce on my behalf my warmest greetings to Mr Flowell, and say, The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár of Chicago is of the greatest importance.  This is a Bahá'í Temple, a supreme House of Worship, a place of spiritual gathering and of the manifestation of Divine Mysteries.  The friends of God must endeavour with all their hearts and souls that this structure may be raised and completed."

Tablet to the American friends from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Translate this Tablet in great haste, and with its original, print and spread.  (Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá.
Through Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb-Upon him be Bahá'u'lláh!-To the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful:
Upon them be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O ye friends and the maidservants of the Merciful!
When the deposed Sultán of the Ottoman Empire, 'Abdu'l-Hamíd, arose in tyranny and oppression, 'Abdu'l-Bahá was incarcerated in the prison of 'Akká and was surrounded with the utmost surveillance of police, detectives and men of the Secret Service.  The door of communication was entirely closed and the means of correspondence was prevented.  If any soul approached the house he was searched; nay, rather, threatened with dire persecution.  The affairs reached to such a degree that, not being satisfied with these restrictions, the Sultán sent an oppressive investigating Commission, so that with all kinds of wiles, simulations, slander and fabrication of false stories they might fasten some guilt upon 'Abdu'l-Bahá in order that he might crucify Him, or cast Him into the sea, or banish Him into the heart of the distant and unknown Sahara of Feyzan (Africa).  That oppressive investigating Commission exercised its rights with tyranny and passed the sentence that 'Abdu'l-Bahá merited all kinds of persecution.  Finally they decided to send Him to Feyzan, and when they cabled this decision to the palace of 'Abdu'l-Hamíd, an answer was received that the matter of Feyzan was approved by the Imperial Order.  Then that unjust investigating Commission returned to Constantinople.  They were in the midst of the sea when the cannon of God boomed forth before the palace of 'Abdu'l-Hamíd, a charge of dynamite was exploded, a number of people were killed, 'Abdu'l-Hamíd fled into the interior of his residence, difficulties and trials surrounded him, and incidents and events developed rapidly.  Therefore he did not find the opportunity to oppress 'Abdu'l-Bahá; public revolution was started, which ended in his deposition, and the Hand of Divine Power released the neck of 'Abdu'l-Bahá from the chains of the prison of Joseph and the fetters and manacles were placed around the unblessed neck of 'Abdu'l-Hamíd.  Be ye admonished, O ye people of insight!  Now 'Abdu'l-Bahá, with the greatest power, has hastened to the country of Egypt from the land of prison.  Praise be to God, that through the Bounty and Providence of the Blessed Perfection, no sooner did he land in Alexandria than the Word of God was promoted and the melody of the Kingdom of Abhá was heard.  All the newspapers wrote innumerable articles.  Some gave the utmost praise; others raised a great cry, saying:  "The arrival of this personage in this land will shake the pillars of Religion and will shatter to pieces ancient customs and conventions.  He attracts every one he meets and when he loosens his tongue in any meeting, it creates faith in the hearts of the deniers." The papers are still writing detailed articles and will continue to do so.
Now the friends and the maid-servants in America have written innumerable letters and all of them are pleading that 'Abdu'l-Bahá make a trip to that country.  Their supplications and entreaties are insistent.  In view of the differences among the friends and the lack of unity among the maid-servants of the Merciful, how can 'Abdu'l-Bahá hasten to those parts?  Is this possible?  No, by God!
If the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful long for the visit of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, they must immediately remove from their midst differences of opinion and be engaged in the practice of infinite love and unity.  No Bahá'í must open his lips in blaming another one, he must regard backbiting as the greatest sin of humanity, for it is clearly revealed in all the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh that backbiting and faultfinding are the fiendish instruments and suggestions of Satan and the destroyers of the foundation of man.  A believer will not blame any soul among the strangers, how much less against the friends.  Faultfinding and backbiting are the characteristics of the weak minds and not the friends.  Self-exaltation is the attribute of the stranger and not of the Beloved.  It is our hope that the believers and the maid-servants of the Merciful in America may become the cause of the union of the East and the West, and unfurl the Standard of the Oneness of the Realm of Humanity.  Now, we observe that strangeness, lack of unity and the utmost difference exists among the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful.  Under such a condition, how can they arise to guide the people of the world and establish union and harmony between the nations of the earth?  His Highness Christ, addressing His disciples said:  "Ye are the salt of the earth:  but if the salt hath lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?"
page 7
O ye friends and maid-servants of the Merciful!  If ye are yearning for my meeting, and if in reality ye are seeking my visit, ye must close the doors of difference and open the gates of affection, love and friendship.  Ye must pulsate as one heart, and throb as one spirit.  You must be like the waves, though they are innumerable they constitute the all-encircling sea.
O ye friends and maid-servants of the Merciful!  Praise be to God, ye are the fish of one ocean, the birds of one rose-garden, the trees of one orchard and the flowers of one paradise.  Then why this difference?  Why this lack of harmony?  Wherefore this condition?
Verily, verily, I say unto you, were it not for this difference amongst you, the inhabitants of America in all those regions would have, by now, been attracted to the Kingdom of God, and would have constituted themselves your helpers and assisters.  Is it meet that you sacrifice this most glorious Bounty for worthless imaginations?  No, by God!  Should you reflect for one moment, you shall become enabled to destroy instantly the foundation of this difference by absolutely refraining from backbiting and faultfinding amongst yourselves.  Adorn with infinite love and concord the assemblage of beatitude, bring about the meeting of happiness, establish the banquet of the oneness of the realm of humanity, loosen your tongues in praising each other, and then anticipate the presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in your midst.
Aside from all these considerations, some of the náqidín20 have come secretly amongst you and are expressing their firmness in the Covenant and with all kinds of intrigues and strategies are creating disorder and calamities, so that ye might be deprived of the Lights of the Divine Testament and subjected to the darkness of violation.
Is it worthy of you to be engaged with differences amongst you and thereby enabling the náqidíns [Covenant Breakers] to spread a noose and chase such firm believers as you are?
I beg of God to confirm you in union and concord that you may become the cause of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity.  Live and act in accord with the Divine teachings, be abstracted from all the attachments of the human world, characterized with merciful characteristics, release yourselves from the nether world, become heavenly souls, spiritual beings and the angels of Paradise.
Upon ye be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

Record of Third Annual Convention of Bahá'í Temple Unity
Monday, 1 May 1911.
[Extracts]
The commune of silence was followed by Mr Mills reading the following Tablet, revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá:
HE IS GOD!
O my God!  O my God!  We are servants who have sincerely turned our faces unto Thy Grand Face; severed ourselves from all else save thee in this Great Day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting of one accord and desire, and unanimous in thought to promulgate Thy Word amid Thy creatures.
O my Lord!  O my Lord!  Suffer us to be signs of guidance, standards of Thy Manifest Religion throughout the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant-O our Exalted Lord!-appearances of Thy Oneness in Thy Kingdom, the Abhá, and stars which dawn forth unto all regions.
O Lord, make us as seas rolling with the waves of Thy Great Abundance, rivers flowing from the mountains of Thy Glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on the Tree of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved by the Breeze of Thy Gift in Thy wonderful vineyard.
O Lord, cause our souls to depend upon the signs of Thy Oneness, our hearts to be dilated with the Bounties of Thy Singleness, so that we may become united as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as are the rays which shine forth from a
page 16
brilliant light; so that our thoughts, opinions and feelings become as one reality from which the spirit of accord may be diffused throughout all regions.
Verily, Thou art the Beneficent, the Bestower!  Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Mighty, the Loving, the Merciful!

[Fragments of the morning session of the Third Annual Convention of the Bahá'í Temple Unity, 1 May 1911.]
In responding for the Chicago Assembly, Mrs Corinne True said:  "When 'Abdu'l-Bahá was asked what would best promote the Cause and bind together the friends, he replied:  'First, the character of the teachers, and, second, the work for the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár.  The teachers must so live that their deeds will teach the people, even if they do not teach by word of mouth.  The teachers are of the first importance; their lives must be examples.'"
...
Responding for [the] Seattle Assembly, Mrs Ida A. Finch read a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, from which the following is a quotation:
"Through the boundless Favour, I hope that in Seattle by the endeavour of the beloved of God, certain souls may arise who may prove a radiant lamp to the world of humanity and merciful spirit to the phenomenal body; that they may be the cause of the purification of souls and the means of sanctification of hearts; that they may know this mortal world as fleeting shadow and call the rest and repose, the pleasure and blessing, the wealth and sovereignty of the earth, the waves of the sea of imagination; that they may arise in such wise to live by the Divine Teachings and Exhortations of the Blessed Beauty as to sparkle even like the morning star from the horizon of holiness."

Brief answers to seven questions
Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
[Second of a series of Tablets containing exhortations to moral and spiritual development.-ED.]
Through Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb and Mírzá Raffie, to Mr and Mrs Ostburg, Boston, Mass.
HE IS GOD!
O ye two seekers of Truth!
Your letter was received and I became informed of its contents.  Some of the letters you have forwarded have not been received, while others have been received at the time of the intense persecutions of the enemy, so it was impossible to reply.  When this last letter was received I found opportunity to answer it, notwithstanding the multiplicity of occupations, so that you may know how much ye are beloved in this spot and accepted in the Kingdom of God.  As there is little time, brief answers are given to your questions:
Answer to the first question:  The spirits of the sons of the Kingdom after the disintegration of this body ascend to the world of Eternal Existence; but should you ask of the place, know thou that that world of existence is the world of unity, but the grades are different.  For instance, the mineral existence has a grade, but that mineral being has no knowledge of the vegetable kingdom.  It (the mineral existence) has no information of a higher realm nay, rather, according to appearances, it may deny the higher grade.  Likewise the vegetable life has no knowledge of the animal kingdom.  It is entirely heedless and unconscious of that kingdom, because the grade of the animal is higher than that of the vegetable.  The vegetable, according to its limited environment, is veiled from the knowledge of the animal kingdom, and it may deny it, although the animal, the vegetable and mineral live in the world of existence.  Likewise, the animal cannot comprehend the intelligence of the faculties of man, which is the generalizer of the universal and the discoverer of the mysteries of beings, so much so that while living in the East he organizes and founds institutions in the West, and he reveals hidden things.  Though he abides in Europe he discovers America.  Though he dwells upon the earth, he unravels the realities of the solar system.  The animal is entirely unconscious, nay, rather, a denier of this intelligent force, which penetrates into the unknown and comprehends the general as well as the particular ideas of this illimitable universe.  Likewise the people of the world lack the knowledge of the world of the Kingdom, nay, rather, they deny it.  Do we not hear from their lips the words, such as these:  "Where is the Kingdom?  Where is the Lord of the Kingdom?" But these souls are like unto the mineral and vegetable who know nothing of the animal and human kingdoms.  They neither see nor search.  However, the mineral, the vegetable and the animal kingdoms all live in this world of existence.
Answer to the second question:  The Divine trials are in this world not in the world of the Kingdom.
Answer to the third question:  The human reality in the other world has no physical likeness, nay, rather, it has the likeness of the Kingdom, which consists of the harmonious element of the realm of the Spiritual Kingdom.
Answer to the fourth question:  The centre of the Son of Truth and of the Supreme World is the Divine Kingdom.  Those souls who are purified and sanctified, after the disintegration of this elemental tabernacle, hasten to the Divine Realm, and that Realm is in this universe, but the people of this world have no knowledge of it, just as the mineral and vegetable kingdoms have no knowledge of the animal and human kingdoms.
page 4
Answer to the fifth question:  His Highness, Bahá'u'lláh, has raised the Canopy of the Oneness of the Kingdom of Humanity.  Whosoever enters under the shade of this all-inclusive Tent, his heart and soul become detached from other tents.
Answer to the sixth question:  Whenever a difference of opinion arises between two parties, refer it to the Centre of the Covenant; so that the difficulty might be solved.
Answer to the seventh question:  His Highness, Bahá'u'lláh, has appeared for the benefit of all humanity, summoning all to the Divine Table upon which is spread the Heavenly Food.  But today the majority of those who partake of this Heavenly Food are poor.  That is why His Highness, Christ, said:  "Blessed are the poor." Wealth prevents the people from entering the Kingdom, as it is stated by Christ:  "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God." But should a rich person not be prevented from entering the Kingdom because of wealth and riches, glory and influence of this world, that rich person will become favoured in the threshold of the Almighty and accepted by the Lord of the Kingdom.
To be brief, Bahá'u'lláh has manifested for the education and training of all humanity.  He is the Teacher of all, whether rich or poor, black or white, oriental or occidental, northern or southern.
Regarding the people who come to 'Akká; some of them make wonderful progress; extinguished lamps they were, they became ignited, withered were they, they became fresh and young; dead were they, and they became alive, returning to their respective countries electrified with the dynamic forces of the Most Great Glad-Tidings.  On the other hand, others have come and left without being touched by this great force.
O ye two attracted ones towards the Kingdom:  Thank ye God that ye have made your house the gathering-place and the assembly of the believers.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

O ye who are attracted to the Beauty of Abhá!
Your letter was received; it indicated that a new union and harmony is created among those souls.  This glad tiding produced a great happiness and a new hope was seized that perchance the friends of New York, God willing, may become united and harmonized with the heavenly power.  Today the most beloved and acceptable deed before His Highness, Bahá'u'lláh, is the union of the friends and the concord of men, and the most unacceptable is difference and disharmony.
Praise be to God that ye have become assisted with this Most Great Bounty, that is, unity and harmony, and become the cause of the happiness of the heart of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.
His Highness, Bahá'u'lláh, said, That if Religion and Faith become the cause of difference, enmity and hatred, undoubtedly its non-being is better than its being.  Consider ye how much emphasis He has placed upon love, harmony and affection.
Upon ye he Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!
It is some time since news has reached me from you.  Today the illumined photographs you forwarded fourteen months ago were received.  By looking at these pictures I remembered you and am writing you this tablet so that you may know I have not forgotten you and am always engaged in your mentioning and your illumined pictures are ever present.
O ye friends and maid-servants of the Merciful!  It is easy to advance toward the Kingdom, but it is difficult to remain firm and steadfast.  Therefore endeavour ye as much ye can to make your faith firm like unto a well-rooted tree and produce blossoms and fruits.  Neither be ye agitated on account of the blowing winds of tests and trials.  The firmer the roots of the tree the greater its blossoms and fruits.  Because the apostles of Christ remained firm and steadfast they became assisted in the most great services and the confirmations of the Holy Spirit descended upon them uninterruptedly.  If ye seek the illumination of the Kingdom ye must arise with infinite resolution.  Be ye not discouraged or lukewarm on account of troubles and vicissitudes.  Show ye an effort so that that region may be illumined, the Kingdom of God may raise its tents and the breaths of the Ho]y Spirit may quicken the souls.

HE IS GOD!
O thou attracted maid-servant of God!
Your letter was received.  From its contents, heart attracting meanings were understood; for they indicated entire attraction by the Kingdom of Abhá and the attachment of the heart to the Supreme World.
The chanting of the verses, whether done individually or collectively, is the cause of manifesting the effect of the Word of God in the hearts, and the means of igniting the fire of the love of God in the breasts.  But it is as thou hast written that the Condition required is, the hearts must become like pure and polished mirrors, and the spirits attain perfect joy and happiness by the divine glad-tidings.
Assuredly the blessed souls who direct their entire attention to the Lord of Hosts, who are severed from the nether world and submerged in the outpourings of the Realm of Might, if they travel in various parts of America, associating with all and visiting the assemblies while surging with the love of God, they will certainly be the cause of the unity of the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful.  This is indeed most beloved and acceptable, productive of great results and conducive of great good.
The enclosed paper sent by thee contained beautiful expressions and delightful statements.  I ask God that thou mayst awaken the people of America thereby from the sleep of negligence and prove to be to them the means of knowledge and wisdom.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá

Tablet to the Bahá'ís of England from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
HE IS GOD.
O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom!
Your letter which was written by heavenly inspiration, whose contents and meanings are full of interest, and whose discrimination springs from hearts that shine, has been received.  Of a truth, the believers of London, being steadfast servants, stand firm.  They shall not slacken, nor, in the lapse of time, shall their light grow dim.  For they are Bahá'ís, children of Heaven and of the light of the Godhead.  Surely, without doubt they shall be the cause of spreading God's Word, and the channel for spreading the Divine Teachings and bringing about the unity and equality of mankind.
It is easy to accept the Kingdom, but it is difficult to endure therein for the tests are hard and heavy.  On all occasions the English are firm and are not turned aside, being neither prone to begin a matter for a little while nor ready to abandon it for a little reason through failing in zeal.  Verily in every undertaking they show firmness.
Though you dwell in the West, praise he to God, you have heard the Divine Call from the East, and like unto Moses you have become warmed by the fire of the Tree that has been lighted in Asia, and you have found the true Path, becoming kindled like lamps, having entered into the Kingdom of God.  Now in thanksgiving for this bounty you pray for blessing upon the people of the world, till by light of the Kingdom of Splendour their eyes become illuminated and their hearts become even as mirrors attaining the rays of the Sun of Truth.
My hope is this:  that the outbreathing of the Holy Spirit be inspired into your hearts, that your tongues begin to reveal the mysteries and to expound the meaning and the truth of the Holy Books.  May the friends become physicians to cure by the Divine Teachings the deep-rooted diseases of the body of the world, to give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, life to the dead and awakening to the sleepers.  Be sure that the blessing of the Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and that the Hosts of the Kingdom will come to your aid.
Upon you be the Glory of God!
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá

News of the cause in London
We were favoured with the foregoing beautiful Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá addressed to the Bahá'ís of England, in reply to a joint supplication sent to him early in the year.
Miss Buckton has just returned from her second visit to 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  The following are a few of the words she brings back from him:  "A Bahá'í is known by his deeds.  The Kingdom of God is not in any Society; but some seekers go through many Societies as a traveller goes through many cities, till he reaches his destination.  If ye belong to a Society already, do not forsake your brothers." ...  "The highest and most successful way to spread the Cause of the Kingdom is by deeds.  This is open to all.  Join yourselves to those who work for the poor, the weak and the unfortunate;-this is greatly to be commanded.  To spread the knowledge of the Kingdom by teaching requires the skill of the physician;-a wise physician does not offer help to those who do not need treatment!"

The Bahá'í Faith
A teaching of peace
Address made before the Third National Peace Congress, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, Saturday, 6 May 1911.
Charles Mason Remey
"We desire but the good of the world, and the happiness of the nations. ...  That all nations should become one in faith, and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened.  ...  These fruitless, strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away and the Most Great Peace shall come. ...  Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind."-Words of Bahá'u'lláh.
Over half a century ago, before the attention of Western thinkers had to any degree been directed toward the problem of Universal Peace, there was born in the Orient a movement for peace and brotherhood, the call of which is now being heard in the Occident.
The Bahá'í Faith has for its object, not only international conciliation, as considered from the political and economic view points, but essentially the unification of the people of all races and religions along spiritual lines.
Religious and racial hatred has been the chief cause of warfare.  Through the removal of these prejudices the followers of this Faith believe that Peace will be established among nations.  Through it thousands of Christians, Moslems, Jews, Zoroastrians, Hindus, and Buddhists, of every race and nationality, are being firmly united in the universal brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God.
In the month of May, 1844, there arose in Persia a teacher, calling himself the Báb, who proclaimed himself to be the forerunner of "He hom God would Manifest"-One who would shortly appear with spiritual wisdom and power, through whose teaching would be established the "divine kingdom" of Peace upon earth.  The Ministry of the Báb lasted six years, and was followed by his martyrdom, as well as the martyrdom of thousands of his followers, which was brought about by the Muslim clergy upon the charge of heresy.
Shortly after the martyrdom of the Báb, the promised one, whose coming he had foretold, appeared in the person of Bahá'u'lláh.21  Under the most severe persecution, Bahá'u'lláh, together with some of his followers, was exiled to Turkey in Asia, then to Turkey in Europe, and later on, in 1868, was sent to the town of 'Akká, a penal colony situated on the Mediterranean, just north of Mt Carmel, in Syria.  Here in 'Akká he lived and taught until he passed out of this mortal world in the year 1892.  He gave his teachings and spiritual instructions, yet during his Ministry his cause was not explained and established in the world in general.  To this end Bahá'u'lláh commanded his followers upon his departure to turn their faces toward his son, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, as their spiritual guide, the explainer of his teachings, the one who would establish his cause in the world, the one upon whose shoulders his mantle would fall.
'Abdu'l-Bahá, also known as 'Abbás Effendi, from 1868 until 1908, because of his teaching, was held a state prisoner in the town of 'Akká.  At present he is in Egypt and there is a possibility that he may visit this country of America.  He makes but one claim for himself, that of service in the Path of God.  His name, 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás, means "'Abbás, the servant of God".  He is the spiritual leader of the Bahá'ís, and is their example to be
page 10
followed in teaching this great faith in the world, He is making the spiritual life of Bahá'u'lláh possible, and bringing it within the reach of the people.
While there have been three teachers in this Cause, Bahá'u'lláh is the central figure, about whom the other two revolve.  It is from his name, Bahá, that the Faith takes its name.  The Báb and his Faith were but introductory to, while 'Abdu'l-Bahá and his work are explanatory of, the Bahá'í Faith.
This religious teaching is brief and simple.  Each of the founders of the great religious systems of the world is looked upon as having been inspired by the one spirit of truth, which is God.  The form and letter of the teachings of these various leaders differ because of the differing conditions of humanity to which they ministered, but in spirit each taught the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of Man.  In the various religions the fundamental truths are one and the same.
Moreover, each of the prophets taught of the coming of a great teacher, and of the establishment of a Universal Religion.  The Jews await the coming of their Messiah, the Christians the coming of the Christ, the Moslems the coming of the Mahdi, the Buddhists the coming of the fifth Buddha, the Zoroastrians the coming of Sháh Bahrám, and the Hindus the return of Krishna.
The Bahá'ís teach that the spirit of these promised teachers is one and the same, and they believe that in Bahá'u'lláh was manifested again this one spirit of truth, The Word of God.  Therefore in his mission and teaching he has accomplished the hopes of the peoples of all religions.  They believe that he was spiritually endowed with the wisdom and understanding necessary to found a new form of religion, applicable to the needs of this day, one which will embrace within its fold people of all races and religions, uniting them in one human brotherhood.
The Bahá'í teaching is in no sense an eclectic philosophy.  It is not a theology, nor does it put forward doctrine or dogma.  It is essentially a religious faith.  It seeks to change man's nature not by enforcing upon him laws from without, but by developing the higher nature of the individual from within.
Among the Muslims the Bahá'í teaching has bad a phenomenal spread.  The several recent progressive changes in the Islamic world in Persia have only been made possible through the introduction into that country of such progressive thought, and freedom from the superstitions of the past, as the Bahá'í Faith stands for and takes with it wherever it goes.  The progressive Muslim finds the Bahá'í teaching to be quite in accord with the spirit of the Qur'án and he accepts it as a new testament added thereto.
In like manner the Jew sees in this Faith the fulfilment of the hope of the millennial age held out to him in his Bible and realizing this he finds himself at one with the Muslim and the Christian.
In going farther into the Orient one finds staunch Bahá'ís among the remnant of the ancient Zoroastrian faith.  These received this message and believed its principles because in their ancient holy literature they find hidden away its simple truths.
Thinking Hindus are also being reached by the Bahá'í thought, and through its positive principle of action and service in bettering humanity they are working to free themselves from superstition and caste.  Thus they are in sympathy with the progress of the world along material and spiritual lines together, whereas formerly their progress was limited because of the negative phase in which Hinduism has been during so many centuries.
The enlightened believer in Gautama, the Buddha, finds in his own teaching the promise of peace and universal brotherhood on earth which makes it easy for him to detect and recognize the fulfilment of the same in the Bahá'í Faith.  To the Buddhist, therefore, the idea of this Faith for the readjustment of earthly conditions and the establishment of peace, is a welcome one.
Of all people, none have taken up the Bahá'í teaching with more fervour than those scattered here and there, where this message has reached, throughout Christendom.  To them it fulfils and accomplishes the hopes of Christianity and they are taking hold of the teach-
page 11
ing as a practical power in daily life.  They are applying its principles and are holding out a helping hand to their co-workers in various parts of the Orient.  Through this spirit of oneness with the Orientals a bond between the East and the West is established, a bond which will strengthen and grow until all peoples Occidental and Oriental will be as one people-until the great universal civilization, which is so rapidly casting its signs before it, shall stand accomplished.
The Bahá'ís have no form of admission to their ranks, nor have they any enrolled membership.  They do not form a sect.  Those who sympathize with their aims they consider as friends and co-workers.  As people work with them, they gradually imbibe the spirit and life inspiring the body of workers until they stand forth as exponents of this new faith.  The Bahá'í s have no outward institutions as barriers to differentiate nor to separate them from other people.
Some of the ordinances of this teaching touch upon the following subjects:
Religious unity:  All men are free to believe and to worship as they will, but they are exhorted to unite in faith, for only through spiritual unity will mankind attain the highest development.
Tolerance:  The Bahá'ís should not separate themselves from people who are not of their belief, nor should they denounce nor antagonize those holding views other than their own.  They should mingle freely with all people and show forth their faith through love and service to their fellow men.
Peace:  Warfare should be abolished and international questions should be settled by arbitration.  In order to facilitate international communication, one language should be chosen from those already existing, or one devised for that purpose.
Government:  Representative legislation is most conducive to the welfare of the people.  The Bahá'í s should be loyal and law-abiding citizens in whatever country they may dwell.  They should not glory in that they love their country, but in that they love their kind.
Worship:  Prayer supplemented by a pure and useful life in this world form the elements of true worship.  Faith without works is not acceptable.  Everyone should have an occupation which conduces to the welfare of humanity, the diligent pursuance of which as in itself an act of worship.
Resistance:  Harshness should be met with gentleness and hatred with love.  With these weapons the Bahá'ís will overcome all opposition.
The Church:  In this Cause there is no priesthood apart from the laity.  Each one who receives the spirit should share it with those whom he meets in daily life.  All are teachers.  Teaching is given without money and without price.
Religious government:  "The House of Justice", a central assembly, the members of which are selected by general vote, is to preside over the affairs of the Bahá'í world.  Its work has to do with charitable and educational matters and the general welfare of the people.
Temperance:  In all matters moderation is to be observed.  Man should not use intoxicating liquors as a beverage.  The taking of opium and kindred drug habits are most emphatically denounced, and gambling is also forbidden.  The use of tobacco is discouraged.
Admonitions forbidding mendacity, slavery, cruelty to animals, and various offences, together with rules regarding public hygiene, education of both sexes and other matters need not here be mentioned, as they are already provided by Western civilization, though in the Orient the need for these is very great.
The effect of these ordinances cannot be overestimated.  In the Orient, where religion is a far more potent factor in every day life than it is here in the West, religious exhortations and injunctions have inestimable weight in the lives of the masses of the people.
page 12
I have made a study of the Bahá'í Faith, and would like to add a few words of personal testimony regarding what I have seen among the Bahá'ís in many parts of the world.
In Persia, where this Faith had its birth; I found that the Bahá'ís had not only overcome the hatred and antipathy which has for centuries existed between Christian, Jew, Zoroastrian and Muslim, but through the uniting spirit of their teaching this previously existing enmity had been replaced by a most binding fraternal spirit.  In the Bahá'í Assemblies all differences of the past had been superseded by the strongest of ties.  In that country these people have suffered much because of the fanaticism of the surrounding people.  Thousands of their members have in the recent past been massacred, while in the present they are under many difficulties.  As recent as 1901 over one hundred and seventy Bahá'ís were massacred in one town by the Muslims.
In Southern Russia and in Turkistan I have visited Assemblies of Bahá'ís.  In these territories the Faith is protected by the Russian Government, for it is understood that the Bahá'ís stand for Peace and are in no way connected with the many revolutionary movements which continually keep those countries in a state of unrest.
In Egypt and Syria, as well as Turkey, I have met groups of Bahá'ís working along progressive lines, but in those countries; as well as in Persia, the outward progress of the work is not as great as the unseen progress.  This is due to the prejudice and persecution of the Muslims, which often leads to bloodshed.
In India the principal centre of the Bahá'ís is in Bombay.  There I found many Pársís or Zoroastrians taking part in the work.  In Calcutta, Baroda, Allahabad, Agra, Lahore, Poona and other cities there are assemblies, and in these meetings Christians, Hindus and Muslims mingle as brothers.
In Burma there is a large Buddhist element amongst the Bahá'ís.  Last year I spent some, time travelling in that country, and was most hospitably received by the Bahá'ís in several towns and cities.  In Japan I found the Bahá'í teaching to be attracting some attention and in China, too, the Faith to have a beginning.  Here in these United States, as well as in Great Britain and Europe, I have visited many assemblies and found the work progressing among people of all classes and of varying religious thought.  Being essentially a spiritual Faith this teaching appeals alike to the enlightened and to the uncultured as it does to people of various religions, races and nationalities.
Notwithstanding the previous attitude of the religionist, which is usually antagonistic to beliefs other than his own, the moment he becomes imbued with the spirit of the Bahá'í s he no longer limits his interest to the mental confines to which he has been accustomed.  He becomes a citizen of the world, freed from national, religious and racial prejudices.  This is noticeable in the Occidental Bahá'í, while in the Oriental Bahá'í it is many times more so, because of the surrounding background of ignorance, superstition and fanaticism against which he stands out emancipated in bold relief.
One who has lived in the Orient and known the Oriental people will at once recognize the importance of the religious factor in bringing about Universal Peace.  It is the religious differences between the Oriental and Occidental which have created the great chasm between Eastern and Western thought, manners and customs.  There being no religious thought in common between the East and West, there is no ground upon which their respective peoples can meet, hence the necessity for a common religion which only car, solve the problem.  The Bahá'í Faith is working directly to bring about confidence, understanding and unity between the Oriental and the Occidental peoples.  Bahá'u'lláh, like all world movers, was far ahead of his time.  A Universal religion, International Arbitration, Peace, a Universal Language, Universal Suffrage, in fact, a Universal Civilization, with all of its universal institutions, was unthought of by the world when he, over half a century ago, first announced these principles.  Now the world in general is awaking to the necessity for those very institutions to which thousands of Bahá'í s have borne witness by persecution and martyrdom.
page 13
Progress is the resounding chord of this day.  Progress in religion is needed more than progress in anything else.  The world is now ready for a live and progressive Faith of brotherly love which is broad enough to take in every race and every people; a Faith which will lead and create progressive thought and progressive institutions; a Faith which will actually produce a change in men's natures, developing within their souls divine virtues; a religion which does not destroy but which fulfils the religions of the past; a religion free from dogma, applicable to all races and conditions, the unique object of which is Peace and the Universal Civilization.  Such a faith is the Bahá'í Teaching.

The Mashriqu'l-Adhkár in America
Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
The maidservant of God, Mrs Corinne True, Chicago.  Upon her be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O thou dear maid-servant of God!
The question of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár is very important and is superior to every matter; surely put forth utmost effort for it.  In the fact that you have registered the name of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the contribution book, I became very happy.
Concerning his honour, M. Mustafá Baghdádí, indeed he was an honourable person, who devoted his days to service in the Kingdom of God, became confirmed in excellent services, a cause of guidance to many, was firm in the Covenant, a promulgator of the Religion of God.  Regarding this a comforting letter was written to Díyá Effendi.22
The receipt you have sent was received.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
The following was written by 'Abdu'l-Bahá's own hand at the bottom of the page:
HE (IS GOD)!
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!
Today in America no matter is greater for the elevation of the Word of God than the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár.  Surely give it the utmost importance.  I am always waiting that a good report regarding the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár should come.
In most of the cities of Persia, even in some of the villages, a Mashriqu'l-Adhkár has been founded.
Now the beloved in America must make effort to establish one Mashriqu'l-Adhkár.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
This double Tablet was translated by Dr Díyá M. Baghdádí, 1 June 1911.

Portion of a recent Tablet to Mrs I. D. Brittingham
If the believers of God in New York and other cities of America establish, in a befitting manner, union and harmony with spirit, tongue, heart and body, suddenly they shall find 'Abdu'l-Bahá in their midst.  Unless this union is brought about, the Breath of the Holy Spirit shall not have any effect, for the physical body must find capacity, so that the life the Spirit may breathe through it.  If the Beloved of the union of the friends and the harmony of the believers become manifest, the East and the West of America shall be perfumed through the sweet fragrance of the Paradise of Abhá, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár shall be constructed, the outpouring of the Sun of Reality shall descend, the everlasting glory of the friends of God shall become apparent and the heavenly life be attained.
Upon thee be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!

A letter answering an inquiry as to what is
The difference between the metaphysical teaching of the present day and that of the Bahá'í Revelation
Ellen V. Beecher
Many of the teachers of the so-called New Thought school have laid down as their first principle-and as a fact-that, as God's creatures, we possess in embryo not only His attributes and His power to dominate our whole being as we will, but they assume that "all is good", because all is a part of God.
Again, that as man holds and operates the creative life forces-which some designate as love-he is himself the "I am" of his being.  Then, by reason of this fact and by the use of will and intelligence, he may not only heal the body, and free it from disease and deformity, but he may do all things, and bring all conditions to himself, by concentration and affirmation.
Lastly, all of these attainments are by his own will and word, because man is an integral part of God.
This is what we understand to be the foundation or fundamental precepts of the so-called "Science", which has been elaborated and enlarged upon by its ardent followers, until its beautiful word pictures have attracted a large part of the civilized world to its fold.
"Well," you say, "the effect of such teaching must be uplifting to the thinking mind."  Yes, it has been exceedingly comforting, and has enthused many souls who were in darkness; and thrown light and joy upon their paths, and brought health to their bodies as well.  But let us see if the foundation stone in this structure is based upon the Truth of God's Word, or upon a basis which cannot stand before His judgements in the latter day, when the "wheat and the tares", which have grown side by side so long, shall finally be separated, and the chaff be burned with the "fire" of God's Love; for "our God is a consuming fire" of all theories and things of man's intellect alone.
We cannot find any revelation in any of the great and accepted religions from God which states or tries to prove that man is an inherent part of Himself.  That God is within all is true.  We were created by God.  He breathed the breath of life in us, which was spirit, and endowed us with the possibilities of attaining His attributes and eternal life.  All life has come from Him; but that did not constitute man any part of God's Essence.  Man was made in the image of God.  An image is only a representation of something which is a picture of the mind, or an idea put in form-the likeness of an object formed by reflection.
Man, therefore, is no more a part of his Creator than the watch is a part of the watchmaker, or the shadow a reality of the thing which cast it.  Man is not even in the image of God's Essence; for that cannot be expressed; he is simply in the image of God's Manifestation.
Before man was created, God thought a form by and through which He could make Himself known to the world, and through which He could speak the Word; and then He honoured man by creating him in this beautiful Image of the Anointed Manifestations of Himself.
It is true that the human spirit may come to recognize the power and work of the Holy Spirit; and by its own development (by grace) come into at-one-ment with the Mind or Will of God, and so attain great wisdom, and even perfection; but on his own plane,
page 15
never on God's plane.  We may be the adopted sons and daughters of God, but no part of His Essence.
All religious sects agree as to the Oneness of God; but we find the Singleness of God emphasized in the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh.  If God be Single, it is a self-evident fact that man cannot be any part of His Essence from any standpoint.  As we have said, man may possess the attributes of God, but they are His gifts, as man comes into at-one-ment with His Will.
The Bahá'í bases all spiritual truth upon the Oneness23 and Singleness,24 then, of God; consequently the Bahá'í knows that man's powers are limited, and his daily confession before the Lord of Glory is:  "I testify that I am powerless and Thou art Powerful; I am weak and Thou art mighty."  Let us turn to the words of Bahá'u'lláh, himself, for confirmation.  In the Book of the Iqan, which is one of his greatest works, he says:
"It is evident to the possessors of knowledge and illumined minds that the Unseen Divinity and Essence of Oneness hath been and is everlastingly hidden in His own Essence, and will be eternally concealed from eyes and sights in His own Identity. ...  No relation, connection, separation, union, nearness, remoteness, position or reference is possible between Him and the contingent things, inasmuch as all in the heavens and earth have become existent by the Word of His Command, and have stepped forth from utter and absolute non-existence and nothingness into the court of the existent and visible-through His desire, which is the Will Itself."
Bahá'ís recognize the fact that man may dominate his body and soul; may heal the body of its diseases, caused by an unbalanced mind; and overcome defects in character, by an understanding of the law of concentration and the human will.  But you observe that the above process is based upon the intellect, or the knowledge of material law; upon reason, and the five senses; all of which belong on the human plane and will never enter the realm of Spirit, for Spirit [the] knows.  It has no need of reason and intellect in that sphere.  We apprehend Wisdom to be the gift of the Holy Spirit to those whose wills have been yielded to the Will of God; for until one's will has been yielded to Him, his intellect and reason will veil him from the inner significances of God's Word and purposes.  Wisdom is the knowledge of the Divine Law, which cannot be obtained through reason and research alone.
You may ask if a man has no need, then, of intellectual pursuit and attainments?  If he should cease to develop his brain faculties and abandon the realm of reason?  By no means, for these powers are given us that our capacity may be enlarged on this plane, so that God may express Himself through us and use us in His kingdom on earth, to prepare those who are seeking Him and be better able to meet all sorts and conditions of mankind-so helping them into the light from their own standpoint; for until man has been quickened from within, he must be taught from the intellectual side of his nature; he must be reasoned with.  We must be able "to give a reason for the hope that is within us," and be able to state the truth so as to be comprehended.  It is our privilege to enlarge our possibilities on every plane, but always to keep in mind the fact of our limitations.
The trend of metaphysical movement within the past few years has been to cause man to assume God's power to be his own, by his right in being a part of God; and its tendency in many cases has been to turn the mind from the Oneness of God to self and self-glorification.
'Abdu'l-Bahá, the Servant of God, whose office is to unlock to man spiritual truth, says,
page 16
that the Holy Spirit dominates every part of the human being when its will is subservient to His Will; that by it we may be healed in body and soul; by its operation we may be transformed and attain to wisdom and spiritual power which nothing on the material plane can withstand.  In speaking of his own station, he says that the Holy Spirit moves his limbs.
Note the difference between, the two processes:  one is attaining physical power and understanding of the natural laws given by Infinite Mind for the control of matter only, while the other is accomplished by the Holy Spirit alone-man's part being simply to yield his will to its guidance and quickening influence.
The highest attainment, as taught by The Christ in Jesus, could be gained only by a complete renunciation of self, a complete submission to the Will of God in all events.
But what does Bahá'u'lláh teach?  He has instructed us that all past teachers from God gave renunciation of self as the highest attainment or station possible in their time, but, in this great day, this is but the first station; that "the servants of God shall never attain to the shore of the Sea of Knowledge except by complete severance from all that is in the heavens and earth."
Perhaps you can get a clearer idea of man as he is if I quote from the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh and his son, 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  They have stated:  "As the world travels in a circle, so also do human beings work out their lives in cycles.  Man begins with God, and from His hand he first reaches the Mineral condition or kingdom, on his descent into matter, and contains latent force or power of growth.  Then he reaches the Vegetable kingdom, which is still only matter, but it has the power of growth added.  Then be progresses to the Animal kingdom, which has the power of the former conditions with a third power added-that of sensation.  At birth man enters the Human kingdom.  This progression is only by the power of God in matter.  The seed of the child grows by the power of God into the human being, just as the seed grows into the tree by the power of the sun.  The human being has the powers of all the other conditions, and has reached the point opposite and farthest from God; has passed through all the material condition of the circle by the hidden power of God."  Man is now ready to begin ascending the scale of spiritual life.  "The soul starts from God, and if it enters the spiritual realms, it may return to God."
"There are three births of man:  first, the material; second, to be born of water, or the Truth and Knowledge of God; and third, to be born of the Spirit.  "... To be born of the Spirit is to give up material desires, and to take on all the qualities of God, and thus he begins to ascend the other side of the circle.  The spiritual half has an indefinite number of conditions, but always progressing upwards."  Bahá'u'lláh has applied a new light to the torch of Truth, so that man may see how to live the true Christian life; how to gain victory over egotism by sacrifice and servitude.
We hold that there are two distinct phases of optimism.  One is based on the assumption of conditions, which the objective mind has first conceived and pictured, as it were, on the walls of the subjective mind.  By holding this thought or picture without wavering, we may possibly bring things to pass.  We may brighten our own paths by happy, cheerful thoughts, and help uplift others who are in negative states of mind.  But this effort must be diligently continued, for all depends upon our own power to hold the pictures formed.
The other kind of optimism is wholly based on the spiritual mind.  It comes by a calm and absolute trust in the power of God to bring to pass all things for our highest good, whatever the seeming may be.  Circumstances and environments cannot destroy it.  Our good may often come through severe tests and trials, so that it may not appear as such on the face of it, but by faith in the power and promises of God to do all things, the silver lining of every cloud is made visible, and one is enabled to obey His command, given through Bahá'u'lláh, to "Cheer up thy heart with delight, that thou mayst be fitted to meet Me and become a mirror of My beauty."

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to the Spiritual Assembly of Baku, Russia
Upon them be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!
HE IS GOD!
O ye friends of God!  O ye manifestors of bounties and favours of the Beauty of Abhá!
That illumined Orb (Bahá'u'lláh) hath risen from the horizon of sanctity and holiness to shed Its Rays upon the expanse of the universe and that mysterious Beloved hath rent asunder the veil of concealment and appeared in the Assemblage of Humanity so that the wooers of His heart-captivating Beauty attained to His meeting, and torrents of spiritual teachings have descended from His Holy Lips, that we may be enabled to hear with the ear of the spirit, walk in the Path of the Beloved; see His Attributes and Manners; behold His Character and Principles; drink the Cup of Bestowal, taste the sweetness of His Reality, obey His Religion and emulate His glorious Example.
O ye friends!  His gentle nature was excellent and His sweet disposition sublime.  He was in the utmost humility and submission, and perfect kindliness and praise.  Worthy courtesy adorned His Being.  He was a refuge for every affrighted one; an asylum for every discomfited one; a fountain for every thirsty one; a Highway of Salvation for every wandering one; a healing to every sick one, and a dressing for every wounded one.  In brief, ye have undoubtedly heard and read His Holy Instructions.  But alas! we have entirely neglected them and are pursuing our own desires, following our own opinions, seeking our own ideas, and chasing our own shadows!  Is it not a shame to change His Rose Garden into a bramble patch?  His Delectable Paradise into a ruined abode?  To seek to eradicate His Foundation and completely destroy His structure?  To forget the Divine Instructions and cast behind our backs
page 4
the Commands of God; with our lips to speak of the waves of the tumultuous Ocean, while inwardly we are dying of thirst; and while claiming divine wealth of consciousness, we are so poverty-stricken in spirit as to be but illusive phantoms-blown about by every wind?
I declare by the Bounty of the Blessed Perfection that nothing will produce results save intense sincerity!  Nothing will be productive of fruit save complete advancement toward God!  Everything is condemned save severance and every idea is fruitless and unacceptable save supplication, communion, prayer and obedience!  We must entirely collect our scattered thoughts, purify and sanctify the house of our existence from every attachment and make the palace of our hearts the nest and shelter of the Dove of Holiness.  Then, and not till then will the significance of confirmation and assistance become evident and known, the power of the Kingdom become apparent, and the hosts of the Supreme Concourse run swiftly into the arena of heavenly conquest, to gain victory over the East and the West of the hearts, and make the North and South of the spirits of men the flowery regions of the Love of God!
Praise be to God that the Province of Caucasia-Baku-is a glorious light in the Lamp of Oneness, a wonderful effulgence from the Sun of Beauty of the Divine Beloved.  Its believers arc sincere and its friends are the favoured ones in the Threshold of Oneness.
Truly I say this is a most great Bounty and a most eminent Gift!
Upon ye be the Glory of God!

Portions of Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Thou hast written concerning the meetings and gathering-places of the believers of God.  Such assemblies and gatherings will greatly aid the promotion of the Word and all the audience, whether friends or not, will become affected.  But when the friends have the intention of entering into these meetings they must disengage the heart from all other reflections, ask the Inexhaustible Divine Confirmation, and with the utmost devotion and humility set their feet in the gathering-place.  Let them not introduce any topic in the meeting except the mentioning of the True One, neither must they confuse that merciful assembly with complex outside questions.  They must either teach or open their tongue in propounding arguments, either commune or supplicate and pray to God, either read Tablets or give out advices and exhortations.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
You have written concerning the spiritual meetings.  The foundation of he spiritual meetings must be the teaching and delivering of the Cause of God.  In these meetings the believers and maid-servants of the Merciful must proclaim the proofs and arguments and explain the signs of the appearance of the beauty of Abhá-May my life be a sacrifice to the beloved ones!  Meanwhile they may read some Tablets, and Communes, and at the end of the meetings, if they desire to sing with the utmost supplication and meekness, it is acceptable.  But the fundamental principle of the establishment of spiritual meetings is for the sake of teaching and delivering the Truth so that those souls who are present may become informed of the Divine Evidences and Proofs.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
Thou hast inquired regarding the teachings and instructions of Bahá'u'lláh!  Thou must instruct the people of the world in the Love of God, that they may eradicate the foundation of warfare and strife, be attracted by the Glad-tidings of the kingdom of Abhá, lay the basis of love and amity, raise the melody of affinity, and the oneness of the Kingdom of humanity; transmute tyranny and persecution into love and faithfulness efface the traces of bloodshed and carnage; construct the edifice of reconciliation, dispel the darkness of estrangement, diffuse the light of unity; change the poison of animosity into the honey of sympathetic affection; destroy the religious, national and social prejudices from the individuals of humanity; live and act, with and toward each other as though they were from one race, one country, one religion, and one kind.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
But regarding teaching the Truth:  One must teach with wisdom, amiability, good-naturedness and kindness.  And should anyone circumscribe conditions (for teaching the Truth) it will become rare.
But concerning the established (organized assemblies), altogether outside conversation must not be introduced therein.  Nay, rather, conversation must be limited to the reading of verses, the perusing of Words and affairs which pertain to the Cause of God, such as explaining proofs and evidences, delivering clear and irrefutable arguments and announcing the signs of the Beloved of the creatures.
Those souls who are in that assembly before their entrance therein must be adorned with utmost purity, turn their faces toward the Kingdom of Abhá
page 6
and enter with infinite humility and meekness, and when someone reads Tablets they must be silent and attentive.  Should anyone desire to speak, he must do it with the utmost courtesy and with perfect eloquence and fluency by the consent and permission of the people of the assembly.
Upon thee be greeting and praise!
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
The believers of God must assemble and associate with each other in the utmost love, joy and fragrance.  They must conduct themselves (in the meetings) with the greatest dignity and consideration, chant divine verses, peruse instructive articles, read the Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, encourage and inspire each other with love for the whole human race, invoke God with perfect joy and fragrance, read the verses of glorification and praises of the Self-Subsistent Lord and deliver eloquent speeches.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá

Thy mission in America for the present is this:  Thou must travel as far as possible to every part and pass through cities and towns, summoning everyone to the Beauty of Abhá, raising the Call of the Kingdom and proclaiming at the top of thy voice:
"A hundred thousand glad-tidings be upon ye that the Sun of the Reality of the Beauty of Abhá hath shone forth from the Horizon of the Contingent Being and hath illumined the regions with the lights of the Most Great Guidance.  The realities of the Old Testament and the Gospel are already fulfilled and the Mysteries of the Heavenly Books have become manifest.  This is the century of the Merciful One and the Period of Joy and Gladness.  O ye heedless ones, become mindful!  O ye sleeping ones, be awakened!  O ye blind ones, become seeing!  O ye deaf ones, become hearing!  O ye dumb ones, become speakers!  O ye dead ones, become living!  O ye deprived ones, take a portion!  This is the effulgence of the Merciful and the moving of the Depthless Sea.  This is the outpouring of the wonderful and new springtime and the falling of the showers of the Bounty of the Most Great Lord!"
This is thy mission.
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
__________
Thy letter was received and read.  Thou hast invited me to America, saying:  "In that region and in that country there are many fragrant and multi-coloured flowers; likewise there are thorns and thistles; but 'Abdu'l-Bahá should not look upon the thistles of the desert.  He must hasten to that country for the sake of the flowers."  This simile is very beautiful; but when a gardener invites a man to his garden, first he will arrange all the flowers with the utmost elegance, beauty and art, then he will invite his guest.  Moreover, there are differences among the flowers.  Therefore pray thou that harmony may be created so that your country may find the capacity for the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  I have the utmost yearning to meet all of you; but unless the conditions which have been previously mentioned are realized, my trip to those parts would be difficult, for it would produce no results.
I hope that all the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful may be united with each other so that 'Abdu'l-Bahá without any cloud may travel from the East to the West.  It is hoped that this unity may become realized.

Four questions and answers
Questions, sent by Professor Cairns, Edinburgh, 24 June 1910:
1)	Is it right to speak of the Báb and of Centre as Manifestations, or as Incarnations?
2)	Do the Bahá'ís teach the doctrine of reincarnation?
3)	Did Bahá'u'lláh claim to supersede the Revelation of Jesus, the Christ?
4)	Did Centre claim to be greater than Jesus, the Christ?
Answers of 'Abdu'l-Bahá (the servant of God), Haifa, 20 July 1910:
O daughter of the Kingdom!
Your letter has arrived.  Its contents caused spiritual happiness and heartfelt gladness.
I wish to answer in detail, but at present my health is not very strong; I am fatigued, so am obliged to write in short.  When I feel better, I will write at length, for verily, you are occupied with the work of the Kingdom and are serving the world of Humanity, and therefore are worthy of correspondence.
Now I will write shortly.
1st Answer.  The Bahá'ís believe that the incarnation of the Word of God, meaning the changing of the nature of Divinity into Humanity and the transformation of the Infinite into the finite, can never be.  But they believe that the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are Manifestations of a Universal Order in the world of humanity.  It is clear that the Eternal can never be transient, neither the transient Eternal.
Transformation of nature is impossible.  Perfect man, Manifestation, is like a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality is apparent and evident, reflected in its endless bounties.
2nd Answer.  In the teaching of Bahá'u'lláh, the reincarnation of the spirit in successive bodies is not taught.
3rd Answer.  Bahá'u'lláh has not abolished the teachings of Christ.  He gave a fresh impulse to them and renewed them; explained and interpreted them; expanded and fulfilled them.
4th Answer.  Bahá'u'lláh has not claimed himself to be greater than Christ.  He gave the following explanation:  That the Manifestations of God are the Rising Points of one and the same Sun; i.e., the Sun of Reality is One, but the places of rising are numerous.  Thus, Beauty is One, but it is shining upon several mirrors.
Your own answers were good; and now I have myself answered in short.
Upon you be the Glory of the Most Glorious!

Recent Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Mr Thornton Chase
Through Mírzá Ahmad to Mr Thornton Chase.
Upon him be Bahá'u'l-Abhá!
HE IS GOD!
O thou herald of the Kingdom!
I received thy two letters, an old one and one of recent date, and both of them were read with the utmost attention.  Praise be to God!  that thou didst not waver before the tests; nay, rather thou didst remain firm and steadfast.  When the tree sends down its roots into the bowels of the earth, then, it will bring forth blossoms and fruits.  Now, Praise be to God! that in this day of the kingdom thou art firm and steadfast.  Rest thou assured that thou wilt become the recipient of confirmation and assistance and the object of infinite bounties.
Thou hast asked about the statement in the Hidden Words, which reads:  "O Son of Spirit!  Turn thy face so that thou mayest find Me within thee.  Powerful, Mighty and Supreme." This is the statement to which His Holiness the Christ, referred His apostles in the Gospel, saying.  "The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in you."
page 12
This is evident that, when the hearts are purified and through divine education and heavenly teachings become the manifestors of infinite perfections, they are like clear mirrors, and the Sun of Truth will reflect with might, power and omnipotence in such a mirror, and to such an extent that whatever is brought before it is illumined and ignited.  This is a brief interpretation because of the lack of time.  Therefore, do thou reflect and ponder over it so that the doors of significance may be opened before thine eyes.
In regard to the philosophy of the Theosophists, these people have borrowed some remarks and statements from the heavenly Books, but they have not attained to the Reality.  Notwithstanding this, they have made these appearances the foundation of their faith and religion.  However, the reality of the question of Unity is thus:
The Sun of Truth hath shone faith from the Horizon of Unity upon all the regions.  All contingent things are clad with the garment of existence through the rays of the sun.  Were it not for the rays of the sun no being would step forth upon the arena of life.  Everything would have remained hidden; nay, rather, the life of the terrestrial beings is continued through the light and heat of the sun to such an extant that all the infinitesimal atoms, which move through this realm of earth, owe their life to the reflection of the sun.  Of course, each being manifests its inward tendencies according to its ability and capacity.  However, no matter how much the sun reflects itself through all the contingent beings, yet it never leaves its supreme height and exalted station.  It (the Divine Sun) is not divided among these beings, so that every being may became a part and a portion of Divinity.
Descent, division, transmission and transmigration in the stations of life are the conditions of the contingent beings, but the Eternal Reality is wholly beyond and above these conditions; for when you behold that a being is subject to division, descent and disintegration, this is a proof of the contingency and impermanency of that being.  The Ancient, the Ever-living, and the omniscient Lord, who is above the comprehension of humanity and is qualified with self-existent perfections, will never descend to the stations of life, and will not be divided so that every man may become an atom or a part of Him.  Children can understand the untenability of this proposition.  This is the pure imagination of the weak minds.
Therefore, according to their theory, the Manifestations of God are infinite in number, and this would leave us to believe in the theory of the "Concatenation of life"; but concatenation is false, and change is the essential condition of the contingent realities, and not of the Eternal Reality.  Ponder deeply over the above explanation, so that it may become evident to thee that by Unity is meant the outpourings of the Divine which appears and manifests in the realities of all existence and especially in the unity of man.
The story of the cock that you have written is very appropriate.  (This refers to the play of Chanticleer wherein the Cock supposed the sun to be caused
page 13
to arise through his crowing, until be was chagrined to learn that its rising was independent of him and his voice.)
Associate with the utmost love and friendship with the Theosophists, and make them comprehend this unity of humanity, which is the unity of the outpouring of the Divine, so they may attain to the essence of the facts.
In regard to the verse, which is revealed in the Qur'án, that His Highness Christ, was not killed and was not crucified by this is meant the Reality of Christ.  Although they crucified this elemental body, yet the merciful reality and the heavenly existence remain eternal and undying, and it was protected from the oppression and persecution of the enemies, for Christ is Eternal and Everlasting.  How can He die?  This death and crucifixion was imposed on the physical body of Christ, and not upon the Spirit of Christ. ...
Regarding my coming to America, it depends upon the realization of conditions of which I have already written to that country.  If those conditions are brought into fruition, rest thou assured that I will present myself, otherwise, it will be difficult.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!

Thy letter was received and its contents became evident.
If America attains to the capacity of the Presence of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, I will travel to that country and all the difficulties shall be solved.
There is no doubt that the tests are severe.  The more a soul resists and shows firmness and steadfastness, the greater will be his progress, and he shall soar to the sublimest heights of the Kingdom. ...
O thou daughter of the Kingdom!  Thou hast expressed the hope of my Presence in America.  It depends upon capacity and merit.
O thou who art attracted to the fragrances of God!  Endeavour thou as far as thou canst to become the cause of the unity and harmony amongst the believers of God. ...

The First Universal Races Congress
Held in London, England, 26-29 July 1911.
Mr W. Tudor-Pole
...
... Great interest was aroused on Thursday during the discussion on 'Abdu'l-Bahá's letter to the congress, the full text of which follows:
Alexandria, 29 May 1911.
To the President, First Universal Races Congress.
My Dear Friend:  Your letter of invitation has been received, and I am much obliged for it.  It is my utmost desire to be present at such a gathering, for I am thoroughly confident that beneficial results shall surely follow these meetings, and that they
page 4
will become the means of establishing friendship and love among the world's different races.  Thus the basis of enmity may be destroyed and the tent of unity of the world of humanity be raised throughout all regions.
I regret much that circumstances may prevent me from attending, but I will endeavour as much as lies in my power to attend.  Failing to do so, pray excuse me.
With a sincere heart I supplicate at the Divine Threshold that this congress may be successful in founding a noble institution which shall be permanent and everlasting; that it may ignite a candle from which a heavenly light shall beam, and plant a tree whose fruit may be friendship, love and unity between all the children of men, so that conflict and warfare may be abolished, and patriotic, racial, religious and political prejudices become unknown.  Peace should replace strife, enmity be superseded by love, estrangement annihilated, and unity established.  The what has been spoken of in the heavenly books will become well rotted in the hearts of all, and the glad-tidings of the sacred writings be fulfilled.  In conclusion I offer my utmost appreciation and respect to such a blessed congress.

Letter from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to the First Universal Races Congress
When travelling about the world we observe an air of prosperity in any country, we find it to be due to the existence of love and friendship among the people.  If, on the contrary, all seems depressed and poverty-stricken, we may feel assured that this is the effect of animosity, and of the absence of union among the inhabitants.
Notwithstanding that such a state of things is obvious to the passing traveller, how often the people themselves continue in the sleep of negligence, or occupy themselves in disputes and differences, and are even ready to slaughter their fellow-men!
Consider thoughtfully the continual integration and disintegration of the phenomenal universe ....  Unification and constructive combination is the cause of Life.  Disunion of particles brings about loss, weakness, dispersion, and decay.
Consider the varieties of flowers in a garden.  They seem but to enhance the loveliness of each other.  When differences of colour, ideas, and character are found in the human Kingdom, and come under the control of the power of Unity, they too show their essential beauty and perfection.
Rivalry between the different races of mankind was first caused by the struggle for existence among the wild animals.  This struggle is no longer necessary:  nay, rather interdependence and co-operation are seen to produce the highest welfare in nations.  The struggle that now continues is cased by prejudice and bigotry.
Today nothing but the power of the Divine Word, which embraces the Reality of all things, can draw together the minds, hearts, and spirits of the world under the shadow of the heavenly Tree of Unity.
The Light of the Word is now shining on all horizons.  Races and nations, with their different creeds, are coming under the influence of the Word of Unity in love and in peace.
The Blessed One, Bahá'u'lláh, likens the existing world to a tree, and the people to its fruits, blossoms and leaves.  All should be fresh and vigorous,
page 6
the attainment of their beauty and proportion depending on the love and unity with which they sustain each other and seek the Life eternal.  The friends of God should become the manifestors in this world of this mercy and love.  They should not dwell on the shortcomings of others.  Ceaselessly should they be thinking how they may benefit others and show service and co-operation.  Thus should they regard every stranger, putting aside such prejudices and superstitions as might prevent friendly relations.
Today the noblest person is he who bestows upon his enemy the pearl of generosity, and is a beacon-light to the misguided and the oppressed.  This is the command of Bahá'u'lláh.
O dear friends! the world is in a warlike condition, and its races are hostile one to the other.  The darkness of difference surrounds them, and the light of kindness grows dim.  The foundations of society are destroyed and the banners of life and joy are overthrown.  The leaders of the people seem to glory in the shedding of blood-Friendship, straightness, and truthfulness are despised.
The call to arbitration, to peace, to love, and to loyalty is the call of Bahá'u'lláh.  His standard floats since fifty years, summoning all of what ever race and creed.
O ye friends of God! acknowledge this pure light; direct the people who are in ignorance, chanting the melodies of the Kingdom of God, until the dead body of mankind quickens with a new life.
Guide the people of God.  Inspire them to emulate the lives of the holy ones who have gone before.  Be ye kind in reality, not in appearance only.  Be ye fathers to the orphans, a remedy to the sick, a treasury of wealth to the poor, a protector of the unfortunate.
Where love dwells, there is light!  Where animosity dwells, there is darkness!
O friends of God! strive to dissipate the darkness and reveal the hidden meanings of things, until their Reality becomes clear and established in the sight of all.
This Congress is one of the greatest of events.  It will be forever to the glory of England that it was established at her capital.  It is easy to accept a truth; but it is difficult to be steadfast in it; for the tests are many and heavy.  It is well seen that the British are firm, and are not lightly turned aside, being neither ready to begin a matter for a little while, nor prone to abandon it for a little reason.  Verily, in every undertaking they show firmness.
O ye people! cause this thing to be not a thing of words, but of deeds.  Some congresses are held only to increase differences.  Let it not be so with you.  Let your effort be to find harmony.  Let Brotherhood be felt and seen among you; and carry ye its quickening power throughout the world.  It is my prayer that the work of the Congress will bear great fruit.

Persian section editorial
We have received from London the advance publication (a large book) of the papers prepared for reading at the first Universal Races Congress, and among them is one from 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  It is the briefest of them all, being very short, only two pages; and its character is entirely different from all the others.  Theirs are largely from the point of view of country and race; his is universal.  Theirs spend much time and words to tell of their ancestral greatness and the abilities of their land and race; he uses few words and little time to teach the oneness of all mankind, their individual and mutual duties, and the needs of the time.  Theirs look to scientific progress, philosophical discussions, courts of arbitration, commercial interests, or socialistic ideas, to bring about the advance and better welfare of mankind.  He goes at once to the root of the matter and says:  "Today nothing but the power of the Divine Word, which embraces the Reality of all things, can draw together the minds, hearts and spirits of the world under the shadow of the heavenly Tree of Unity.  The Light of the Word is now shining on all horizons ....  Races and nations, with their various creeds, are coming under the influence of the Word of Unity in love and peace."
In brief, the thought of practically all of those who submitted papers to the Congress, was from the human point of view, while that of 'Abdu'l-Bahá was from the Divine Seeing.  His was primary, theirs secondary.  His presentation referred to the very seed and root of the matter; theirs to the branches and twigs, or results.  They failed to perceive that all the advances of science, philosophy, ideal and action grow out of the spiritual enlightenment of mankind through the radiance of the Sun of Truth, which is now bathing the world
page 8
in splendour.  He points mankind to the Word, the Spirit, and its workings in the hearty of men; they point to the results, as though they originated with man alone.  Several of them speak at more or less length of Religion as affecting the ideas of men and nations, but they limit religions to racial conceptions rather than to the Spirit of God as an active, actual Power among all men.
But it is a wonderful and glorious sign of the times and a proof of the working activity of the Spirit, that men from many nations, grown under different trainings, coloured with different mental and spiritual ideas, should gather in such a congress, without political intentions, and only with the purpose of promoting the mutual acquaintance, respect, friendship, peace and prosperity of the races of mankind.  It is another of the fast multiplying proofs of the Divine Mission of Bahá'u'lláh.
Without any apparent instigation or influence from Bahá'í sources, it proceeds to forward greatly the very principles which Bahá'u'lláh came to promulgate and to impress on mankind in this time of the ending of the old and the establishment of the new.  This fact alone is sufficient to prove that the Word of Bahá was the declaration of that Divine Spirit which is working in the consciences and hearts of men all over the world to bring to pass that which He proclaimed as the duty of men in this new age.  Those writers and speakers from many nations were busily calling attention to the appearance of the "new earth"; while 'Abdu'l-Bahá proclaimed to them the advent of the "New Heaven".
The new earth must indeed be prepared for the establishment upon it of a new heaven.  This is true of the physical world, the conditions and environments of mankind, as it is of the individual man, who contains within himself the earth and heaven of his dual nature.  But there can be no re-creation of the earth itself except it be from the power of the Spirit, its Creator.  Men of perception note the wonderful changes going on in the material realms of earth and mind, the revealing of hidden laws and power, the discoveries of actions and conditions which conduce greatly to the improvement of man's abilities, but they do not yet perceive that all this advancement comes from the presence and action of the Mighty Spirit of God, that Universal, Invisible, Creating Light of Divine Intelligence, which surrounds, penetrates and permeates every atom of existence, throughout all space and the "Spaceless".  All things-"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from alcove and cometh down from the Father of lights." (James 1:17)  O that men would recognize the bounty of God and turn to Him in praise and thankfulness for all that they have and are!

Tablets from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Muhammad 'Alí Khán
Translated by Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb
To Muhammad Ali Khán, Tihrán, Persia.
HE IS GOD!
O thou intimate companion!
The flame of reformation is ignited in the heart and soul of Persia and the spirit of every real reformer is longing for better conditions.  For Persia is sick and is suffering with intense agony.  But the children of the East are abiding under the shade of the banner of discord and are completely heedless and veiled Now, what remedy can be applied!  The sick Persia is flying away from the physician; nay, rather that thirsty one is depriving himself of the sea of the salubrious water of health.  Therefore, this exiled one has found no other alternative than to turn his face towards the West and raise the melody of the Kingdom; for to a certain degree the insight of the people in those parts is open and they are familiar and associate with reason and understanding.  When Joseph found that his envious brothers and his jealous relations and friends were heedless and unmindful, he unveiled his face in the market of the Egyptians, so that in exile he might destroy the foundation of strangeness and raise the banner of unity.  Therefore, it is the aim of this exiled one, that, God willing, he may become the Herald and carry the gladtidings of the Kingdom to the empires of the West.  Perchance the splendour of the Beauty of the real Joseph-the Most Great Name-May my life be a sacrifice to Him-may shine from the countries of the Occident; and I beg of God that the glances of mercifulness may assist.
I hope that the bounties of the True One may become realized in thee, but it is conditional upon thy serving the Real Master and living in accord with the manners and behaviour of the real Bahá'ís and showing the utmost sincerity and beauty of intention.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!

O thou servant of God!
Thy letter was received.  Praise be to God, that the call of the Kingdom of Abhá reached Pittsburgh.  Should the friends of God show firmness and steadfastness, the ray of the light of the Kingdom of Abhá will shine and that state and city will become illuminated.
Endeavour thou that thou mayest study the Persian language thoroughly, so that thou mayest read the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh and comprehend their meanings.
In reality, if someone should go to the Netherlands and engage in teaching the Truth great results would follow.  Although such a person cannot he found for the present, yet before long he shall be discovered.
I supplicate and entreat at the Kingdom of Abhá and ask heavenly confirmation for thee.  Perchance, God willing.  at some future date we may meet each other.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá
San Francisco
Through the maid-servant of God, Mrs Helen S. Goodall, to the Members of the Assembly of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, San Francisco, California.
HE IS GOD!
O ye faithful friends!
The maid-servant of the Kingdom of Bahá'u'lláh has written the joyful news that the friends in that region have established an Assembly, have engaged in the spreading of the teachings of God and have arisen with the utmost endeavour, sincerity of intention, and enkindlement with the fire of the Love of God so that that country may become a main-spring of the signs, and that city become illumined, and a number of souls like stars of the Horizon of Holiness may shine in the assemblage of the Kingdom of man (humanity).
This Assembly was organized at the right time.  It is my hope that it may become a magnet of confirmation.  If it remain firm and steadfast this Assembly will become so illumined that it will be a full, refulgent moon in the Horizon of everlasting Glory.
Report and write to me the services which are accomplished by this Assembly so that they may become the cause of spiritual happiness and joy to the heart.
Upon thee be the Glory of God!
(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá

Impressions of 'Abdu'l-Bahá while at Ramleh
Mr Louis G. Gregory
I am asked by the Star of the West for impressions gathered during a recent pilgrimage to 'Abdu'l-Bahá at Ramleh and the Holy City.  Now I can respond but briefly; but later I hope that a full account may be given to the friends of the Cause of all the valuable lessons received from the Perfect Man.
It is the will of 'Abdu'l-Bahá that all the friends should be united and happy in the light of the Kingdom.  On one occasion Bahá'u'lláh said, "My Presence is happiness and peace.  Hell is the hearts of those who deny and oppose."  Today the happiness and peace of the Glory of God (Bahá'u'lláh) are reflected in the clear Mirror of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  Thus by meeting him one meets all the Prophets and Manifestations of cycles and ages past.  It is difficult for one to realize at the time, or for a long time afterwards, the true honour of such a meeting.  To one who realizes even faintly who this Servant of God is and what powers he represents, such a meeting is high above all the honours of earth.  But no soul can give adequate testimony of what 'Abdu'l-Bahá may be to any other soul.  With mental and spiritual horizon more or less limited, each pilgrim discerns according to his capacity the Majesty and Power that radiate from the Centre of God's Covenant.
At Ramleh, 'Abbás Effendi25 might at times be seen walking about the streets.  Oft times he would ride upon the electric tramway, making change and paying his fare in the most democratic fashion.  His reception room was open to believers and non-believers alike.  Upon a visit to some unfortunates one day, I asked if they knew him.  "O yes," they responded, "he has been in this house."  Thus in one way or another thousands of persons had opportunity to see 'Abbás Effendi; but among these how few perceived 'Abdu'l-Bahá!
Viewed with the outer eye, he seemed about the medium height, with symmetrical features.  His lineaments indicate meekness and gentleness, as well as power and strength.  His colour is about that of parchment.  His hands are shapely, with the nails well manicured.  His forehead is high and well rounded.  His nose is slightly aquiline; his eyes light blue and penetrating; his hair is silvery, and long enough to touch the shoulders; his beard is white.  His dress was the Oriental robes, graceful in their simplicity.  On his head rested a light tarbush, surrounded by a white turban.  His voice is powerful, but capable of producing infinite pathos and tenderness.  His carriage is erect and altogether so majestic and beautiful that it is passing strange that anyone seeing him would not be moved to say:  "This truly is the King of men!"
On the rational plane his wisdom is incomparable.  During the time of my visit persons of culture were present from different parts of the world.  But people of acquired learning are but as children to 'Abdu'l-Bahá.  They were reverent in their attitude toward him and one of them, an Oxford man,
page 6
praised his wisdom with much enthusiasm.  They sought his advice and found it of the highest value in application to life.
'Abdu'l-Bahá has the power to make his friends very happy.  What music and harmony, joy and peace, may enter into the lives of those who attain this meeting!  He has a balm for every wound and feeds hungry souls with the Manna of his Perfect Love.  One of the friends at Cairo, a noted worker in the Cause, exclaimed, "If I could only see 'Abdu'l-Bahá once a week!"  At 'Akká and Haifa were to be found those who had spent most of their lives with him.  But they were all longing for his Presence.  Among the letters received by him at Ramleh was one from the daughter of a king, expressing as her utmost desire a visit at the threshold of his door.  This is the Power of the Spirit.
Thus the friends of the Cause may catch a glimpse of what is in store for them if he visits America.  Nor should we spare any pains or hesitate at any sacrifices to ensure his coming.  The Reality of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the supreme joy of the Kingdom, is found by promoting that which tends to unity and harmony among the friends of God and the whole human family.
"O Son of Man:  Lift up thy heart with delight, that thou mayest be prepared to meet Me and to mirror forth My Beauty."

Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Extract from a Tablet received by Áqá Mírzá Taráz-u-lláh of Gazwin, Persia, concerning the Star of the West:
In regard to the Star of the West which in Rasht fell into the hands of strangers.  There was a wisdom in this.  It will have great effect in the future.  The editors of the newspapers are mistaken.  The literature of the Bahá'ís has encircled the world and not alone Persia.  The derision and the scorn of the editors of the newspapers will be the cause of their own undoing and regret.  They must loosen their tongues in thankfulness and praise and glorification that-Praise he to God!  Persia has found such influence in America that a magazine like unto the Star of the West is founded.  This behoveth them to be thankful and not complain.  This is the cause of the glory of Persia and the Persians and not their shame.  How long this community does not behold the wonders and miracles of Thy Lord!

Towards spiritual unity
An Interview with 'Abdu'l-Bahá
Dialogue between 'Abbás Effendi and Rev. R. J. Campbell, M.A.
[Extracts]
...
Some months ago I received private information that 'Abdu'l-Bahá might possibly visit this country, and recently he dispatched from Switzerland the telegram published in our columns a fortnight ago.  On Monday evening of last week "The Master," as his followers naturally call him, arrived in London, and on Tuesday I had the privilege of meeting him.  "What is he like?"  Let me quote the words of one who visited him at 'Akká a few years ago:
"He is of middle stature, strongly built.  He wears flowing light-coloured robes.  On his head is a light buff fez with a white cloth wound about it.  His long grey hair rests on his shoulders.  His forehead is broad, full, and high, his nose slightly aquiline, his moustaches and beard, the latter full, though not heavy, nearly [now quite] white.  His eyes are grey and blue, large, and both soft and penetrating.  His bearing is simple, but there is grace, dignity, and even majesty about his movements. ...  We see the benignity and the kindliness of his countenance."
It was interesting to find 'Abdu'l-Bahá well acquainted with The Christian Commonwealth.  "He is very pleased with what you write in your paper," were the first words, after a cordial welcome that came through the Interpreter.  "Some of the papers write things that he does not like and are not correct, but you write about what you know."  The production of an early copy of our last issue caused some merriment.  The fact that it was printed a day before the date it bore amused him, and when the paragraph, "A meeting between 'Abdu'l-Bahá and the editor of The Christian Commonwealth took place yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon.  Some particulars will probably appear in our next issue," was translated to him, he said, with twinkling eye, he was very pleased with our "prophetic writing".  Of the preceding passage, referring to the fundamental unity of all religious faith, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said, "You have written all that I can say to you.  That shows that we are one in spirit."
...

... Three years ago, on the proclamation of the Turkish constitution, he became free.  During his long imprisonment he thought not of himself, but of others; he enjoyed continual communion with God, he ministered to the needs of his fellow-prisoners, and it was because he lived this unselfish life that he survived while many others perished.  "A captive for the cause of God," his interpreter explained, "his prison was to him as a palace.  His body was suffering, but his soul was free."
The invariable tendency on the part of the followers of a great religious leader is to attribute to him supernormal powers.  'Abdu'l-Bahá emphatically disclaims possessing any such, and even deprecates the description of himself as a prophet.  He told me he had never spoken a single word implying that he had right to such an
page 5
appellation.  "I am simply a servant of God," he said, "and I do not wish to be called anything more than that."  He assured me that he has no desire to found another sect.  "The foundation truth of Bahá'u'lláh is the foundation truth of all religions.  The principles of the prophets of Israel and of Jesus Christ and of other religious teachers have been largely forgotten; Bahá'u'lláh has renewed them.  Therefore, the Bahá'ís have for the followers of other religions the greatest love and yearning, because they know that mankind is one.  Bahá'u'lláh seeks to promote and establish friendship and union.  He addresses himself not to a sect, but to the whole world.  We are all branches of one root, blades of grass in one meadow.  It is misunderstanding that has caused divisions and differences between mankind.  If the truth were brought to people they would understand that they are all one, and each would say, 'This is the truth I have been looking for.  Because the principles taught by every true prophet are the same; there is no difference between them.'"
"What is the distinctiveness of the Bahá'í faith?  What is its special contribution to world-religion?"
"The proclamation of the unity of mankind, and consequently, peace between all nations and also the renovation of the teaching of the prophets whom God has sent to the world, and its presentation in a form suitable to our time.  When Bahá'u'lláh appeared in the East proclaiming the unity of mankind all the powers of Persia were directed against him but in spite of all opposition he spread his message.  For fifty years he endured, often in chains, the greatest suffering; four times he was exiled from country to country but his voice could not be silenced, his influence could not be stopped.  As a result of his life and teaching the different sects of Persia are becoming one family of God; the Muslims, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians who have accepted Bahai-ism are now in the greatest unity and harmony.  There is no more any war between them; each honours the head of other religions:  Muslims are honouring Moses and Christ; Christians are honouring Muhammad and Moses; Jews are honouring Jesus and Muhammad.  They have learned to love one another, and are becoming one.  The cause of unity is the cause of life itself, it is divine; that which leads to division or hatred is satanic.  Religion should make for unity.  The prophets did not come to bring about distrust and separation.  Ignorance is the cause of division and hatred.  Religion is like medicine; it is meant to cure, but in the hands of unskilled or bad physicians what should effect a cure may create disease, what should give life may cause death.  Therefore we must strive with all our strength, with all our heart, to promote only that which leads to unity and life."
...
... In one conversation I sought his impressions of England.  Coming straight through to London, and having so far had only a few motor drives in the West End, he has not had much opportunity of observing the life and habits of the people generally, but already he has been much impressed by the freedom we enjoy.  "I admire the liberty you have in England and the use you make of it," he said.  "Every person in this country can go his own way and say what he thinks without anyone making him afraid; in fact, he is king of himself."
"Do you consider we have too much liberty?"
"Oh, no; you all seem to be perfectly comfortable and perfectly safe.  Freedom of thought and speech enlarges the circle of one's understanding and leads to progress and unity.  English people ought to be happy."

I happened to be in the room when Rev. R. J. Campbell was announced.  There were also present several English ladies, Mr Dreyfus-Barney (who kindly acted as interpreter), Tamaddun'ul-Mulk ('Abdu'l-Bahá's secretary), ....
Meeting between 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Mr Campbell
...
'Abdu'l-Bahá first inquired after Mr Campbell's health, and said he had been very anxious to meet him.  The conversation then proceeded as follows:
R. J. Campbell:  I have long looked forward to this opportunity.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  That is proof that both our hearts are at one.
R.J.C.:  I think that is true.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  There is a Persian saying that hearts that are at one find their way to one another.
R.J.C.:  I do not think that saying is peculiar to Persia.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  Often two people live in the same house in constant intimacy, but their hearts are not united.  Here are two men, one living in the hast and one in London, whose hearts were coming to meet one another long ago.  Although in the material world we were far apart, we have always been near in the spiritual world.  The real nearness is the nearness of the heart, not of the body.
R.J.C.:  The spirit knows no nationality.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  Praise be to God that now there is between us a material as well as a spiritual tie, the union is perfect!
R.J.C.:  I am so glad that you took the resolution to come to England, even though you can remain only a short time.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  From the time I left Egypt my purpose was to come here, but I remained a few days on the Lake of Geneva for change of air.
R.J.C.:  I know many of your friends who are also mine.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  I have read your sermons and speeches.
R.J.C.:  And I have read yours.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  That is a proof of unity.  As I have read your sermons (with a humorous smile), you have to read mine.
R.J.C.:  I see on my left one who has spoken from my pulpit (Tamaddun'ul-Mulk).
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  We are all friends of one another (hands raised as in benediction).  We have spread the proclamation of universal peace, therefore we are friends of people all over the world.  We have no enemies; there are no outsiders; we are all servants of one God.
R.J.C.:  That is good.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  Worshippers of one God, we are recipients of the graces of one God.  Men have made differences and divisions; God did not establish them..  God has created every one, and treats every one equally.  He is merciful to all and gives food (lit. "livings") to all.  God knows every one.  To him none is a foreigner.  We must follow his example.
R.J.C.:  What is distinctive of the Bahá'í movement as compared with the faith out of which it came?
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  The Báb foretold the coming of One after him who would address the whole world.  We are the followers of that One-Bahá'u'lláh.  When he manifested himself, some of the followers of the Báb did not receive him.  Those are called
page 7
Bábís; the disciples of Bahá'u'lláh-are Bahá'ís.  The Báb came as a reformer of Islám, and foretold the coming of a greater one in his footsteps.  Instead of confining his revelation to the Muslim world, Bahá'u'lláh gave it forth to all mankind.  The narrow-minded ones, even those who meant well, could not understand so broad a movement, they were not strong enough to follow Bahá'u'lláh; they said, "He is speaking a language we cannot understand."  Therefore they are called Bábís.
R.J.C.:  What a close parallel to primitive Christianity!  The Judaising portion did not wish the Gospel to go any further.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  It has come about, by their narrow-mindedness and exclusiveness, that the Bábís are now opposed to all the other religions; they want to keep rigidly to the teaching of the Báb, and convert everybody to it.  The Bahá'ís recognize the truth in all religions.  They come from the same root, but there is now that difference.
R.J.C.:  A difference of attitude.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  Their conduct is absolutely different.
R.J.C.:  How many Bábís are there?
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  Very few.
Interpreter:  Perhaps 200 or 300 in Persia.
R.J.C.:  It is suggested that there are three million Bahá'ís.
Interpreter:  There are no statistics.  The Bábís are more politicians than anything else.  Some Persians, who do not live the life, are not acquainted with the life, claim to be Bahá'ís, because they know the Bahá'ís are the advanced people.
R.J.C. (to 'Abdu'l-Bahá):  I should like you to visit the City Temple.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  I should like to come.  I know that the City Temple is a centre of progress in the religions world, and seeks to promote a universal understanding.  As you have been a promoter of unity in the Christian world I hope you will strive to bring about unity in the whole world.  A man first wants unity in his own family, and then as his intelligence expands he wants unity in his village, then in his town, then in his country, then in the world.  I hope you will strive to unify the whole world.
R.J.C.:  We are doing what we can.  We believe that religions are many, but Religion is one.
'Abdu'l-Bahá:  The principle of religion is one, as God is one.
A Lady:  Mr Campbell's reform movement in Christianity is helping the world of Islám.  The attitude of the New Theology is one Muslims can understand; they cannot understand the divisions of Christianity.
R.J.C.:  I have had some evidence of that.

Address by 'Abdu'l-Bahá at the City Temple, London
[This is almost identical to the version in 'Abdu'l-Bahá in London.  Some of the differences (word order, plural for singular, etc,) may be simply accidental, others are corrections of minor grammatical errors in this version.]
"O noble friends, seekers after God, praise be to God!  Today the light of truth is shining upon the world in its abundance.  The breezes of the heavenly garden are blowing throughout all regions.  The call of the kingdom is heard in all lands, and the breath of the Holy Spirit is felt in all hearts that are faithful.  The Spirit of God is giving life eternal.  In this wonderful age the East is enlightened, the West is fragrant, and everywhere the soul inhales the holy perfume.  The sea of the unity of mankind is lifting up its waves with joy; for there is real communication between the hearts and minds of men.  The banner of the Holy Spirit is uplifted, and men see it, and are assured with the knowledge that this is a new day.  This is a new cycle of human power.  All the horizons of the world are luminous, and the world will become indeed as a garden and a paradise.  It is the hour of unity of the sons of men, and a drawing together of all races and all classes.  You are loosed from ancient superstitions which have kept men ignorant, destroying the foundations of true humanity.  The gift of God of this enlightened age is the knowledge of the oneness of mankind and the fundamental oneness of religion.  War shall cease between nations, and by the will of God the Most Great Peace shall come; the world will be seen as a new world, and all men shall live as brothers.  In the days of old an instinct for warfare was developed in the struggle with wild animals; this is no longer necessary; nay, rather, co-operation and mutual understanding are seen to produce the greatest welfare of mankind.  Enmity is now the result of prejudice only.  In the Hidden Words Bahá'u'lláh says 'Justice is to be loved above all.'  Praise be to God, in this country the standard of justice has been raised; a great effort is being made to give all souls an equal and a true place.  This is the desire of all noble natures.  This is to-day the teaching for the East and for the West; therefore, the East and the West will understand each other and reverence each other, and embrace like long-parted lovers who have found each other.  There is one God; mankind is one; and the foundations of religion are one.  Let us worship Him, and give praise for all his great prophets and messengers who have manifested his brightness and glory.  The blessing of the Eternal One be with you in all his riches, that each soul according to his measure may take freely of him!  Amen.
After the service, in the City Temple vestry, 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a few sentences in Persian in the pulpit Bible and added his signature, as follows:
This book is the Holy Book of God, of celestial inspiration.  It is the Bible of Salvation, the noble Gospel.  It is the mystery of the Kingdom and its light.  It is the Divine Bounty, sign of the guidance of God.-'Abdu'l-Bahá.
Asked by Mr H. W. Chapman his impressions of the service, 'Abdu'l-Bahá replied:  "It Is an assembly which is turned to God.  The light of guidance is shining luminous here.  The bounty of the Kingdom was spread, and all hearts were praying to God."  As he took his departure 'Abdu'l-Bahá said in English, "I am very happy."  So were we all!

Report by Mr Remey
Mr Chas. Mason Remey, of Washington, D.C., has returned from London, Eng., bringing the following message from 'Abdu'l-Bahá to the friends in the West.
Regarding the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár, 'Abdu'l-Bahá said, "Its building is the most important of all things.  This is the spiritual foundation.  For that reason it is the most important of all foundations.  From that Spiritual Foundation will come forth all manner of advancement and progress in the world of humanity.  Therefore, how great is its importance."  Later on 'Abdu'l-Bahá said that the believers have many duties to perform.  They should associate themselves with and assist all good causes.  Aiding and supporting educational, charitable and other philanthropic institutions should form a part of their work.  They should serve and unite with all people in humanitarian works.
